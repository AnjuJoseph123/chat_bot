0,"Last year, we shared that we were evolving Shopify Unite to a series of events in cities around the world. We loved getting together with the community, but realized that we still couldn’t be in enough places to connect with everyone.At the same time, we introducedShopify Editions, where we brought together the biggest product updates for our ecosystem and put them all in a new digital experience, for everyone to interact with anytime, anywhere.We want to do the same thing with Shopify Unite.Instead of limiting the event to only a few cities, we want to open up the experience to reach even more developers. As part of its continued evolution, we’ll be moving to a virtual event in early 2024 where you’ll be able to deep dive with the Shopify team on the latest releases for our developer platform. There will be opportunities to interact with each other as well as the Shopify team through office hours and technical AMAs. Stay tuned for more updates.And while virtual gatherings are great to make sure everyone can join, we know how much the community values in-person gatherings as well. So we’ll continue to share opportunities to connect IRL, starting with some new formats coming soon.We can’t wait to continue building the future of commerce with all of you."
1,"As a Shopify Partner, there are multiple ways to earn through your contributions to the Shopify ecosystem. When you build a development store, you can earn up to a20% recurring referral commissionon the Shopify subscriber fees for each client you refer. By consistently referring clients who sign up for Shopify plans, you can earn a steady stream of commission. Highly engaged Shopify partners find referral commissions to be a valuable tool that can be used to hire more staff, expand services, negotiate with clients, and scale business. Learn how to get started.Step 1: Build A Development StoreTo earn referral commissions for the development stores you build, you must refer a client bybuilding a development store in the Partner Dashboard. A development store is a free version of a Shopify store that can be used to design, build, test and optimize stores for your client. You can also leverage it to test themes and apps as you build a store. As a Shopify Partner, you can use our full development store environment to build as many stores, or test as many apps or themes as you want.Step 2: Client Subscribes To A Full-Price Shopify PlanAfter creating a development store,transfer store ownership to your client. When the transfer is complete and your client subscribes to a full-price paid plan, Shopify pays you a recurring commission equal to 20% of the merchant's monthly subscription fee on Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans. For Plus referrals, you will earn a recurring commission equal to 20% of the Plus merchant's monthly base platform fee. Note: Stores that are built as part of a Shopify free trialare not eligible for referral commission. You can only earn referral commissions by transferring a development store (not a trial store) to a merchant.Step 3: Receive Your Recurring Monthly Commission PaymentUpon successfully referring a new client, you'll receive your referral commission payout on a monthly basis through the Shopify Partner Dashboard. As an active Shopify Partner, you'll continue to receive your monthly development store referral commission for each client you’ve referred. You must remain an active Shopify Partner to continue earning commissions by referring at least one active merchant to Shopify at least once every 12 months, or by upgrading an existing Shopify merchant to Shopify Plus, as outlined in thePartner Program Agreement. For additional eligibility details, review theActive Shopify Partner requirements.Grow your business with the Shopify Partner ProgramIn addition to earning from development store referrals, there aremore ways to earn when referring to Shopify Plus and POS.Whether you offer marketing, customization, or web design and development services, the Shopify Partner Program makes it possible for our partners to build and grow their business.

The exception is still reversals to pending charges. In these cases, we highly encourage partners to issueapplication credits, which Shopify Support can then apply to the invoice.Please contact Partner Support with any questions about this change.Contact supportDeep linking for theme app blocks now availableWe’re making it easier for merchants to install apps in context. App developers can now generate a deep link that takes merchants to the theme editor, where a desired app block will be added automatically for the merchant to preview and adjust prior to saving.Deep linking simplifies your app's installation flow, because merchants won't need to navigate to the theme editor, find the block, and then act on it. Instead, your app does the work for them. Because merchants can preview the block, you're providing them with control over what they include in their storefront.Learn morePartner email verificationTo keep the Shopify App Store safe and secure and to better serve our partner community, we will begin enforcing partner email verification.Your contact information allows us to share important information and updates related to your business.

3,"When building products for Shopify merchants, it's critical to run thorough tests to ensure features are working as expected, and to understand how your app or theme responds to different conditions. Having a robust test environment is essential for validating functionality and performance, as well as ensuring a seamless user experience.To help you achieve a realistic testing environment, Shopify has recently launchedgenerated test datafor new development stores that contain typical ecommerce primitives, and configured settings that are needed to effectively test an app, theme, or custom storefront. These development stores include demo products, test orders, a theme optimized for the diverse data set, some Shopify Plus-specific features, and more.In this article, we'll explore the different types of demo elements available in the generated test data set, discuss the benefits of using generated test data, and highlight the use cases that can significantly speed up your workflow. By using development stores with generated test data, you can create an environment that closely mimics real-world scenarios, making your testing process more efficient.Types of generated data and potential use-casesTo give you a head start when you're testing out a feature of your app or theme, we've analyzed the most relevant aspects of Shopify for developers and created various data primitives that provide authentic examples you can use during tests.The full list of commerce primitives and configurations is found in ourdeveloper documentation, but in this blog post we'll highlight some of the possible use cases. By leveraging these different data types, you can quickly simulate specific user interactions, and identify potential issues in your app or theme.ProductsOne of the first things you'll notice when you spin up a new development store with generated data is that the store comes with a set of snowboard products. Each of these snowboards has unique product characteristics, from the Multi-managed Snowboard which is fulfilled by both a fulfillment service and a store location, to the Minimal Snowboard, which only contains required fields, to the Complete Snowboard which is fully stacked with variants, tags, vendor, type, sales data, markets, and more.The generated Complete Snowboard is fully stacked with variants.The benefit of having access to a range of products with different attributes is that you'll be able to see how your app or theme responds to products that are in various states. This set of products will help you identify where potential issues might be encountered with unexpected product-related scenarios.For example, your app may use theme app extensions to expand the product detail page, so you'll want to ensure it's displaying as expected for products in different states. You may find for specific states, such as if a product is sold out and unavailable, your app should react differently. By testing how the app makes changes or reacts to different types of demo products, you can identify when potential bugs and issues could arise.For developers who are working with integrations related to gifting, we also have sample gift card products that you can test, and you'll also findmetafielddefinitions on some of the snowboards if you need to work with custom content.Other use cases that could be applicable for testing with these demo products include:Inventory management testingProduct content display and rendering 3D/AR modelsSearch and filtering functionalityIntegration with ERPs and fulfillment management systemsCross-selling and upsellingBundling and product kitsManagement of reviews and ratingsHandling digital products and distributionWholesale and B2B functionalityIf you're building on Shopify and interacting with a store's inventory , you can leverage our sample products to ensure your app or theme is catering to a wide range of potential use cases.OrdersAn essential component for testing, particularly for app developers, is order management and processing. Similar to the demo products, our pre-populated development stores include a set of ten sample orders with various characteristics such as different fulfillment and payment statuses, tags, locations, customer notes, and delivery methods.The generated test data set includes a range of orders with different properties.Orders are central to Shopify and the general merchant experience, connecting to many different parts of the admin and beyond. These different orders allow you to test how your app might handle scenarios related to order processing and fulfillment, inventory management, and syncing data between Shopify and other platforms.For example, you might be building an app that connects Shopify stores with a third-party fulfillment platform, to streamline the shipping and fulfillment process. In this case, the app would need to sync order data, shipping details, and inventory updates between Shopify and the third-party platform. Using demo orders, you could test the flow of data between Shopify and the third-party fulfillment platform to ensure the integration is working correctly by updating inventory levels, sending tracking information, and handling order modifications.Other use cases that you could use these test orders with include:Order processing and managementInventory management and backorder handlingMulti-channel order supportOrder analytics and reportingReturns and refunds managementTax and currency handlingDiscounts, coupons, and gift cardsCustom order workflowsDiscountsIf your app expands Shopify's core offering for discount campaigns, scheduled sales, and promotions, the set of five discounts that are included in generated data development stores will be valuable for testing different discount scenarios. By testing your app with a range of different discounts with various properties, you can ensure there are no checkout issues and that your app handles discounts as expected.Test out functionality with the range of discounts available in the generated test data.The discount codes we've created as part of the generated data have configurations that capture automatic, buy X get Y, basic coupon code, and free shipping discounts, as well as being connected to specific product variants too. Developers can leverage these pre-configured discounts to test your app's ability to handle diverse promotional scenarios and ensure that the app correctly applies and manages these incentives.An example of how these demo discounts could be used might be if you're creating an app that enforces restrictions on discounts during a flash sale. In this scenario, your app may be creating and updating exclusions on an existing demo discount code. You could test the app's functionality by checking that changes made via the app are populating across to the correct discount and that the discount is being applied as expected on the checkout.Other use cases that you could use these test discounts with include:Handling activating and expiring discount codesScheduling promotionsManaging customer notifications with discount informationSyncing discount data with third-party softwareGenerating advanced analytics related to discount sales dataAnalyzing promotional performanceManagement of loyalty program discountsCreation of dynamic discounts that respond to custom conditionsCustomersTo test app functionality that is related to customer accounts, the set of generated data on pre-populated development stores includes some customer accounts you can access from the store admin. These demo customer accounts have a range of different attributes, like existing order history, contact information, company, and notes, so you can use them for testing the different states and scenarios that are possible with customer accounts on Shopify.The generated test data developer stores include three customer accounts with different attributes.These pre-configured customer accounts can be used to test your app's ability to handle customer management features and ensure that your app can handle various customer-related scenarios.For example, your app may help merchants with their marketing strategies, so you would want to test your app's ability to create targeted customer segments and apply specific marketing strategies to different customer groups. By using these demo customer accounts, you could ensure that your app is effectively creating and managing these segments, based on criteria that maps to available customer attributes.Other use cases that demo customer accounts would be valuable for include:Handling personalized product recommendationsManaging customer communication and conditional notificationsAutomating customer support interactionsTracking customer order data and creating reportsIntegrating with ERPs and third-party management toolsCreating a referral program for customersThemesThe new theme architecture that was introduced withOnline Store 2.0, and specifically JSON templates, has allowed app developers to easily add dynamic elements to merchant's stores viatheme app extensions. However, not all Shopify merchants use themes that have been updated to use JSON templates, which means many app developers build out logic to support ""vintage"" themes that are not compatible with theme app extensions.To help developers test their apps with both new and vintage themes, development stores created with generated data ship with a modified version of DawnandDebut, which is not compatible with theme app extensions. These themes can be used to verify that your app supports both newer and vintage themes that could be installed on merchants’ stores. You can learn more about how apps can support different themes typesin our developer documentation.The test data theme has been optimized for testing purposes.The ""Test data"" theme is the default theme for development stores using generated test data, and contains some modifications to enhance its value to developers. Support for selling plans has been implemented on the product page, which allows you to see how selling plans appear in the storefront. Additionally, we've pre-configured theme settings to provide an authentic-looking storefront without having to customize settings yourself.Some use cases that testing your app with these demo themes allow include:Analyzing how your app integrates with different design elementsEnsuring an app's features don't conflict with a theme's design or functionalityMaintaining a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile deviceHandling potential conflicts or issues that arise due to a theme's codeDetecting and adapting to the store's language and currency settingsOptimizing the impact of an app on storefront performanceEnsuring the app's interface is usable with screen readers and other assistive technologiesConfirming the theme's functionality and appearance remain unaffected after the app is uninstalledOther primitives and configurationsThis blog post is not an exhaustive list of all the commerce primitives and configurations that are available with generated test data. You can readour developer documentationto view the full set of data.Some other possible use cases that developers could leverage generated test data for include:Ensuring payment processes are working correctly by simulating transactions with the automatically-configured bogus gatewayConfirming that an app is able to access metafields correctly with demo metafield definitionsVerifying that B2B-related functionality is working as expected for merchants on Shopify Plus with demo companiesAssessing how your app is transferring data to a custom fulfillment platform with demo fulfillment servicesTesting that your POS app is receiving retail store information by demo locationsEnsuring your app is able to manage and organize international markets information with our set of demo markets dataFaster testing, faster developmentBy using these development stores as your test environment, you can quickly see how your app or theme interacts with specific store data, or reacts to particular scenarios. Using generated data will reduce the time required to set up primitives yourself, and allow you to focus on building the best products for Shopify merchants.What kinds of Shopify store settings and primitives would you like to see included in the generated data set?Let us know in the comments below!"
4,"Shopify POS is a flexible, customizable tool for brick-and-mortar retailers, thanks to the support of third-party apps. Apps are an easy and effective way to build and solve essential in-store and omnichannel tasks, and positively impact the merchant experience. Unlike traditional point-of-sale (POS) systems, apps are front and center of the Shopify POS experience, making it easier than ever to customize workflows to suit any business need.Now, with new POS UI extensions, you have the technology to extend the functionality of the Shopify platform like never before. POS UI extensions enable developers to write simple React or JavaScript/TypeScript code that is translated into native app code, which is seamlessly integrated into the POS experience while preserving performance and rendering native UI.In this article, we take a look at the details of how POS UI extensions work, and how some app developers are capitalizing on the opportunity of extending into Shopify POS.Get started with POS UI extensionsWith faster load time and powerful capabilities to build custom functions, POS UI extensions build better, faster apps that look and feel native to Shopify, significantly improving the user experience. Get started today by visiting our documentation below.Visit docsWhy we’re building POS UI extensionsUsing UI extensions to extend apps into the Shopify POS takes the guesswork out of the user experience both for merchants, and for you as a developer. You can now build specific POS workflows using components and libraries built by experienced developers, without sacrificing performance.The benefits of building with POS UI extensions are:Improved app performance thanks to faster load timesHigher user engagement in-app through highly-integrated workflowsEasy implementation process so you can capitalize on new opportunitiesWe have launched two new extension points for the Smart Grid. The Smart Grid is the home screen on the Shopify POS app where you can add different tiles representing frequently accessed products, collections, features and third-party apps. The two new extensions available for the Smart Grid are the Tile and the Modal.1. The Smart Grid Tile extensionThe Smart Grid Tile extension point displays information about the extension and opens the Modal, which contains the primary app functionality.POS UI extensions applying a discount.The tile is fully dynamic and can respond to changes in the cart or the backend of your app. For example, using the updated Receive Transfers POS UI extension, the tile could display a subtitle indicating the number of transfers, prompting the user to investigate.The tile can also be a quick and powerful shortcut on the Smart Grid. For example, a discount app could apply 50% off a purchase when a customer buys five items. The tile could detect the five items in the cart and go from a disabled state to an enabled state, displaying 50% off available.2. Modal extensionThe Modal extension point is a full screen display. Using the Modal extension allows for more space to visualize information and complex workflows, improving the UI experience.Modal componentsWorrying about styling updates and keeping up with Shopify’s design system Polaris meant maintaining a bunch of CSS files. Now, building with POS UI extensions means using modal extension components that mirror the look and feel of the Shopify POS experience. When Shopify makes an update to the component library, the extension is automatically updated.How Shopify developers are already working with POS UI extensionsWe opened access to POS UI extensions to a few select developers, to help implement and test how these extensions really worked in retail and omnichannel environments. One such developer was Sammy Isseyegh and the team atStackable Discounts, a POS app that combines multiple promotions from discounts to manual codes, giving customers the benefits of cost savings and merchants a handy way to apply multiple discounts to the cart. The team at Stackable Discounts rebuilt their app using POS UI extensions.“Because of the nature of the app opening multiple times during a single checkout, the time it took to load the screen and for our app to do the calculations and apply the discounts was difficult for merchants,” says Sammy.Stackable Discount was built usingPOS Link, which responds to changes to the cart. Once items are scanned, users click the Stackable Discounts tile on the Smart Grid to calculate and apply discounts.“The app is now just a fundamentally better experience,” explains Sammy. “It is ten times faster, consistent across iOS and Android, and solves top pain points for merchants. The code is much cleaner and easier to look after.”Andrew Cargill and the team at app development companyZapietagree. Their app helps merchants maximize sales and stay in control of orders and logistics with delivery, pickup, and scheduling functionality. Retail is a priority for them.“Our app is all about physical retail stores,” Andrew shares. “Merchants are always interacting with Zapiet.”Zapiet also built their POS app using POS Link. It looked exactly like the desktop version, containing all the features and elements you would expect when administering orders from the Shopify admin.“When you are at the POS in a busy shop and a customer is standing in front of you, you don’t need all the elements in the admin dashboard. It is a very different customer experience.”Zapiet’s customers were reporting slow load times, but the development team had limited options due to a long integration authentication process. “We were prepared to build something ourselves just to make it faster and easier for our customers.”Zapiet joined the early access program for POS UI extensions to jump at the opportunity to solve this challenge. They had the basics of the rebuilt app up and running in two days, plus a few weeks to build out the rest.“It was super fast to get up and running. You code and instantly see the changes locally in real time,” says Andrew. “It is a huge help. The development speed is significantly faster. We are just writing with React and it's beautiful out of the box.”More flexibility to come with POS UI extensionsWhile we’re starting with the Smart Grid Tile and Modal, since they’re such an interactive part of POS, we have plans to add new components to continue extending the POS functionality. So, whether you’re getting started with building an app for retail for the very first time, improving the efficiency of a current extension, or building totally new functionality, POS UI extensions will transform app performance using the extensible platform that will power the future of apps for Shopify POS.Additionally, POS is a growing market with exciting opportunities to grow your business into new spaces. Buyers want a seamless and engaging retail experience, and merchants are looking for opportunities to meet this demand. The opportunity for apps to support these requirements and facilitate these experiences directly from POS is expanding.Whether you are looking to improve the efficiency of a current extension or build totally new functionality, retail is a green space in theShopify App Store.To get started building POS UI extensions, visit ourdeveloper documentation.

5,"Checkout is the foundation of commerce, and we can now definitively say that Shopify's is the best.A new external study conducted by a leading global management consulting company analyzed the conversion performance of major commerce platforms as well as custom builds and showed that Shopify's overall conversion rate outpaces the competition by up to 36% and an average of 15%.It also showed the power of Shop Pay, Shopify’s accelerated checkout offering. When used, it can lift conversion by as much as 50% compared to guest checkout, outpacing other accelerated checkouts by at least 10%. The mere presence of Shop Pay, according to the study, can increase lower funnel conversion by 5%.This data is a powerful tool to use with prospective clients, reinforcing Shopify’s four unique checkout advantages: our massive identity network, unmatched scale, consumer trust, and velocity of innovation.When leveraging like-to-like samples, Shopify outperforms the competition by up to 36% and by 15.2% on average. Some of those peers are depicted here.Identity networkThe future of commerce is identity-driven, and digital wallets are the vehicle.More and more brands are realizing the conversion benefits of removing friction and reducing the overall steps required at checkout, and no other wallet does this better than Shop Pay, in large part due to its massive identity network.Over 100 million high-intent, high-value buyers are pre-opted into one-click checkout with Shop Pay. It’s the single most popular and trusted digital wallet on Shopify.When a prospective customer with a Shop Pay account hits a storefront, Shopify can recognize them with one click. At checkout, it can even recognize the majority of them without any user action if they've used Shop Pay recently. That enables Shop Pay to pre-fill customer information for a seamless one-click checkout, which means a 4x faster experience than a guest checkout.When a prospective customer with a Shop Pay account hits a storefront, Shopify can recognize them with one click.Brands that provide personalized experiences to their customers, including a checkout they know and trust, are able to remove some of the friction within the buying journey to ensure higher conversion. Shop Pay is an ideal solution for these retailers and a proven way to increase conversion.Travis Hess, EVP of DTC at The Stable, Part of Accenture SongThe massive identity network, ease of use, and extensibility of Shop Pay is even more powerful with the support of Shop Pay Installments and Shop Cash. They create a win-win checkout experience for shoppers and merchants alike—and ultimately increase conversion by as much as 50% compared to guest checkouts.ScaleFor Shopify, scale is both an asset we use to improve checkout and something we can handle with ease. It's what allows us to power millions of brands and build with the largest enterprises in the world.Shopify currently powers approximately 10% of U.S. ecommerce, has processed over half a trillion dollars of GMV, and supported 561 million unique online shoppers in 2022. We leverage this unmatched volume of data to improve checkout at an amazing pace. This includes smaller changes, like optimizations in button display and field order, as well as bigger changes like our recent introduction ofone-page checkout.Our customers' experience is the most important thing to us. They need to trust our checkout as much as they trust our products—and recognize the path to purchase as easily as they recognize our brand.Kyla Robinson, Vice President, Digital Product, SpanxShopify Checkout also handles the most important annual sales events with throughputs that would take down most commerce platforms and custom builds, but shine on Shopify. Our peak holiday sales event in 2022, for example, netted $7.5 billion in total sales, with Shopify Checkout processing $3.5 million in sales per minute. We’ve even seen a brand have more than 40,000 buyers checking out at the same time, continuously for a few minutes, without so much as a hiccup. If it’s reliable for the largest flash sellers in the world, it’s reliable for all sellers.As a partner, you can have confidence knowing the customers who hit your client’s checkout are going to have a great buying experience, for the big moments that count and every moment in between.Consumer trustHundreds of millions of people use a Shopify Checkout every year. The look, feel, and flow of our checkout has become highly recognizable, and therefore trusted.But Shopify Checkout isn’t just a familiar experience, it’s a delightful one. It’s seamless, fast, and unfussy—and built to deliver what your clients need to meet customer expectations, like delivery promises, BOPIS, tax and duty calculation, post-purchase expectations, discounts, and more.The seamless experience of Shopify Checkout is the byproduct of many features working together in perfect harmony and the perfect foundation for you to build a standout checkout experience for brands.Consumers know, trust, and love Shopify Checkout. It’s no wonder its conversion rate outpaces the competition by up to 36%.InnovationAt Shopify, we have larger teams working just on innovating checkout than some other platforms have on their entire commerce solution. Building on our platform ensures your clients are always on the cutting edge of checkout technology.But checkout isn’t a walled garden—what makes it so innovative is that it enables you to innovate.Shopify provides all the essential components while allowing businesses to innovate and customize to fit their needs. The toolkit of options is endless, depending on what’s most important to your clients. You can mix and match bespoke code written in custom apps with no-code, easily configurable apps for your Shopify store to lower total cost of ownership, increase speed to market, and pivot to shifting buyer demands quickly. This is the power ofcheckout extensibility.But it doesn't stop there. Checkout extensibility is fully compatible with Shop Pay, making it the only fully customizable one-click checkout. You can customize Shop Pay's look and feel, and add functionality either through click-and-configure apps or by building bespoke apps for your customizations.Shopify’s Checkout allows us to build exactly what our clients want without sacrificing performance or innovation. This is critical for us when making recommendations on which platform clients should use, and a main reason we continue to recommend Shopify.Peter Kang, Co-Founder and CEO, BarrelNew sales enablement resources for partnersWe’ve been working on our checkout for nearly two decades, and we’ve learned a lot.

6,"It’s evident that brands and retailers that effectively create personalized shopping experiences for individual customers can drive customer loyalty and increase sales. Customers are 76 percent more likely to consider buying from brands that personalize the consumer experience, according toa 2021 report by McKinsey & Company.There are many ways to help your merchant clients personalize shopping experiences for their customers—but what strategies are actually successful? And, crucially, what mistakes should brands avoid when incorporating personalization into their ecommerce strategy?For this article, we quizzed leading Shopify Partners and personalization experts for their insights into the biggest personalization pitfalls you should avoid and what to do instead to create more engaging digital customer experiences on your clients’ ecommerce stores.Let’s start with a look at how segmentation can help tailor the shopping experience to specific customer groups and increase your client’s conversions.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success. Join for free and access educational resources, developer preview environments, and recurring revenue share opportunities.Sign up1. Focusing personalization only on the core customersOne of the biggest mistakes Francis Pilon, director of sales atLimeSpot, sees brands make when approaching personalization is to assume that a baseline implementation targeting their core customers is sufficient and will have a positive impact on all shoppers on their site.“Even within a common demographic or a targeted product set, visitors have different needs, shopping goals, and buying behaviors,” Pilon explains. “The impact of only targeting that baseline user is that other segments of visitors do not connect with the brand experience and remain unengaged.”The impact of only targeting that baseline user is that other segments of visitors do not connect with the brand experience and remain unengaged.Francis Pilon, Director of Sales, LimeSpotPilon suggests considering a skincare brand whose primary target market is women: The core demographic is women aged 25-40, however there are others who come to the site. For example, there may be a strong segment of older women, with different needs and different buying criteria, who want to be acknowledged with a customized experience. Understanding how to effectively tailor their shopping experience and delight them can have a huge impact on a brand’s bottom line.So what steps should you take to more effectively personalize your merchant clients’ shopping experience for these audiences?Pilon recommends starting by defining key segments based on their lifecycle stage, affinity, and context, such as first-time visitors, collections, and geolocation. Using a platform that provides real-time segmentation can both help you identify what these segments are, and give you the ability to target them.“For instance, if a majority of first-time shoppers show interest in sustainable practices you may want to show them social proof on the homepage for validation,” Pilon suggests. “Whereas returning customers who are already knowledgeable about the brand may want to easily find related items to what they’ve purchased in the past.”Once you have your hypotheses, Pilon advises beginning with some basic customization—as few as two to three components of the shopping experience, such as product recommendations, category merchandising, and content, can make the difference. Then A/B test to measure effectiveness; adjust, expand, and repeat.Begin with some basic customization, then A/B test to measure effectiveness. Adjust, expand, and repeat.Most brands already understand the benefit of segmentation-based customizations, Pilon says. However, until recently, only larger brands had the resources required to turn such knowledge into actionable insights. Fortunately there are now powerful, affordable, low-effort personalization solutions for brands of all sizes—and using a one-size-fits-all model is leaving money on the table.LimeSpot enables you to transform any element on an ecommerce site into a targeted message with personalized images, text, and CTAs (Source:LimeSpot).2. Limiting personalization to just one area of your storeKate Collinson, an ecommerce consultant and growth marketer specializing in Shopify and Shopify Plus, warns against just focusing on one area of a store when implementing personalized experiences.“Think about how it can provide a customer value throughout every touchpoint with your business,” she advises. “Personalization is a value exchange—the customer needs to see value in handing over their private information.”Collinson points to her client, Shopify merchantKat The Label, as a best practice example. The Australian lingerie store uses a quiz to help customers to find their size in a product, and then remembers it throughout the browsing experience, so the customer is reminded of their relevant size throughout the entire journey.Collinson takes it a step further by syncing this data with the CRM in combination with what is received from other platforms such as Okendo reviews and back-in-stock notifications to segment communications with customers.Lingerie store Kat The Label helps customers find their right product size and then remembers it throughout the customer journey (Source:Kat The Label).3. Not tracking data from the experience itselfAnother common mistake Collinson sees merchants make is investing a lot of time and energy in using the data from their CRM or survey to create a personalized experience for their customers, but then not setting up data points to assess how it impacts the business’ bottom line.As a Shopify Partner you can guide merchants on this to demonstrate the return on any work. Focus on the metrics that are going to move the needle, not just vanity metrics of what’s been achieved.“Whether it’s using Google Tag Manager or an in-built analytics platform, identify the metrics that would prove something is working. And ensure you set up any relevant tags upfront so you can analyze how customers are responding to your personalized experience,” Collinson suggests.For example, if you’re using custom CRM data to trigger an automated series to guide the customer, this may be built into the platform you’re using. But Collinson recommends that if you’re customizing what the customer interacts with on the homepage through something likeShopify Scripts, you’ll need to set up custom tags to analyze this data in Google Analytics or a similar platform.The biggest errors stores make can be easily fixed with developer support.Meanwhile, Freddie Wynne and Adam Goodman, product managers atLoyaltyLion, believe the biggest errors stores make can be easily fixed with developer support. They suggest avoiding the following four personalization pitfalls and advise on what to do instead to drive a better digital customer experience:4.Not pre-filling fields where possibleThis one is simple: don’t make your customers do any extra work, especially if you want to provide a seamless, personalized shopping experience. Pre-populating information for customers removes friction and improves conversion rates.5. Not showing prices or shipping rates in local currenciesResearch shows that76 percent of consumersprefer making payments in their local currency, and they certainly don’t want to be surprised with generic shipping rates. Reduce basket abandonment by delivering on the details and localizing their shopping experiences.6. Not creating a sense of urgencyNotifications around limited stock or back-in-stock alerts can prompt shoppers to make their next purchase sooner, or prevent them from dropping off completely. Applying order cut-off times for next-day delivery can also help to move them through their transaction faster.7. Not capitalizing on the integrations between Shopify appsTools should be set up to talk to one another so that data points can be passed from one to another to deliver more personalized and engaging experiences. This can include, for example, passing loyalty data points from LoyaltyLion into emails or SMS sent fromKlaviyo, or enabling support teams to see loyalty statuses and points balances as they work withinGorgias.It’s essential to keep in mind that personalization can also lead to negative outcomes if not executed correctly, warns Juan Manuel Gonzalez, founder and CEO of strategy retail consulting firmG & Co.Personalization can also lead to negative outcomes if not executed correctly.Specifically, Gonzales points to three critical mistakes:8. Invading customers' privacy by collecting too much personal informationBrands should only ask for information that is relevant to the shopping experience and avoid using data for purposes other than enhancing the customer experience. Moreover, companies should implement robust security measures to protect customers' sensitive information from data breaches.9. Over-personalizing the experienceWhile personalization is meant to improve the shopping experience, bombarding customers with too many personalized recommendations and advertisements can quickly become overwhelming and alienating. Companies should strive for a balance between personalization and a customer-friendly experience.10. Personalizing experiences based solely on demographic information or past purchasesPersonalization must go beyond this and take into account customers' current context and behavior. For example, if a customer is browsing on a mobile device, they may have different needs and preferences than if they were browsing on a desktop computer, vice versa.Ross Beyeler, the chief operating officer atTrellis Commerce, meanwhile thinks brands should also consider the following seven mistakes when incorporating personalization into their ecommerce strategy:11. Limiting product recommendations to the PDPA product detail page (PDP) will likely have a “recommended products” section below the “add to cart button.” While this is a great starting point for providing product recommendations and upselling customers, there are many other areas within your website that you should consider.Tools likeNostomake adding product recommendations to search results, collection pages, landing pages, and the shopping cart easy and personalized based on customer behavior and shopping history.12. Missing out on empty search resultsIf your company sells more than a handful of SKUs, customers will likely search for something that leads them to a “dead end.”Instead of giving them a “No results” message, tools likeAlgoliaallow you to take note of these searches and set up custom redirects or product recommendations that might be a close match to what customers are seeking.13. Forgetting to do retargetingRetargeting customers already engaged with your brand is one of the most turnkey ways of personalizing your interaction with them.Tools likeYotpoallow you to capitalize on products viewed, products added to cart, etc., which can be a valuable way to convert visitors into buyers.14. Discounting low margin productsPromotions such as discounts and offers are essential in driving sales, particularly for value-minded customers. However, failing to keep an eye on product margins can lead to significant losses. You’ll want to make sure whatever promotions you’re running consider the “landed cost” of products (i.e. COGS, shipping/handling, return rates, etc.).15. Overlooking first-party dataPersonalization is about using what you know about customers to inform how you engage with them. Since iOS14, much of the previously procured data from social media platforms is no longer accessible.That change has given rise to “first-party data,” where merchants introduce tactics such as post-purchase surveys using tools likeFairingto build their own set of customer data.16. Giving away more than you need toPricing discounts are a great way to drive conversion, but you should consider testing “how much is enough"" to ensure you’re not giving away more margin than you need to.Apps likeDexterallow you to run A/B tests on product prices, and platforms likeTalon.Onewill enable you to personalize and test your promotional campaigns as a whole.17. Failing to differentiate by customer journeyNot all visitors are created equal. You’ll want to offer different promotions and recommendations based on where they are in their “customer journey.” Consider whether they’re a new vs. returning customer, first-time or repeat visitor, someone who has spent a lot of time on the website, etc.Tools likeBloomreachallow you to incorporate this content into content, promotion, and product personalization.Bloomreach’s integration with Shopify enables the introduction of data-driven personalization into an commerce experience regardless of whether it’s a headless or traditional online store.18. Forcing brands to work with disconnected tech stacksChristina Donati, content and partner marketing lead atAlloy Automation, explains that at one point in the past few years the SaaS companies that power ecommerce tech stacks deprioritized integrations. And she understands why:“It was difficult for these startup companies to balance building integrations while improving their product,” Donati points out. “One of these things had to give. Unfortunately, building out core product features takes priority. So, many companies put integrations on hold to increase market share and reach more customers. Because of this, we see more siloed tools than ever.”According to Donati, however, brands need integrations, and as more siloed tools enter the market, brands are left with disconnected tech stacks—and lots of manual work completing time-consuming tasks.“This is a recipe for churn for SaaS companies that aren’t offering integrations,” Donati cautions. “For brands, this means they can't automate specific tasks and are left spending hours every week on manual work, or they're forced to pay agencies a lot of money for custom integrations.”Donati therefore believes that tech companies need to get back to also prioritizing integrations for their customers: “It helps with product retention and enables your partnership team to go to market with other platforms in the space strategically.”19. Not using automation to work smarterEvery ecommerce business has finite resources, time, and cost when it comes to producing quality products along with a quality customer experience. Donati argues that to improve any area, others must take a hit:“Launch a new project improving quality? Cost, resources, and time will increase. Try to reduce the budget? Increase the time needed on projects. Reduce time on a project? Increase cost and resources.”This resource, time, and cost trade-off is true for every business owner. Everyone is juggling their balance of resources, time, and cost to operate. As businesses grow, the pressures of daily operations can become overwhelming, however. Time that could be used for key tasks like refining a product offering and engaging with customers is often sucked up by urgent but mundane details such as restocking materials or navigating customer service issues. It's easy to get bogged down in all these small challenges.So how do you help your clients stay on top of it? Donati believes the answer is investing in automation tools, which can help manage these repetitive tasks across marketing, customer support, and back-office operations (like shipping and order fulfillment).20. Thinking there's still an ""ecommerce growth playbook"" that will guarantee successIn the past, it was easier to funnel money into paid advertising and see an ROI. This isn’t the case anymore—there’s no single blueprint for growth.These days there are many different ways to grow a business. Here are three Donati recommends you should make your client aware of:Focus on providing value to your target customers on the channels you enjoy creating content for the most. If you prefer to write, start a blog and focus on SEO. If you like being on video, get on TikTok. Build an organic engine early and consistently.Determine how to cut costs without impacting your product quality or customer experience. For example, change your packaging to a cheaper, sustainable option. Or, automate your operations tasks so you waste less time on repetitive day-to-day things.Build true connections with your customers—not a transactional relationship. If we head into a potential recession, people will be cautious about where they spend their money. Deeper connections mean customers feel comfortable supporting your mission and values, even during a downturn.All of these mistakes feed into whether the personalized shopping experiences you create for your client’s customers will be successful. Some mistakes can be easily avoided while others can take some time to undo if they’re already embedded practices in your client’s online store. But personalization doesn’t have to be complicated. There are some simple ways to integrate personalized shopping into the customer experience.One easy way to introduce product personalizationTo offer shoppers a personalized shopping experience when they’re browsing your client’s store, you could start with something as simple as offering color, flavor, fabric, and texture variants on the product page based on the type of customer who visits that page.Deb Mecca, director of marketing at Shopify appIn Cart Upsell, points to two examples:OnOlipop's product pages, a shopper can click on a specific flavor variant to see the exact product they’re interested in, showcased on the left.To start small when implementing personalization on an online store, consider offering flavor variants on a product page, as done here by soda brand Olipop.And bridal boutiqueGigi & Oliveoffers available color swatches for products to allow the shopper to personalize their garment. When considering a color, the shopper can choose from a drop-down menu of color options based on the color scheme of their wedding.Allowing your client’s customers to personalize their products makes them feel more connected with their decision and the item they decided to purchase (Source:Gigi & Olive).“This makes the customer feel more connected with their decision when purchasing the product because they are viewing what they will be receiving when their order arrives,” Mecca explains.Differentiate your clients’ stores with careful personalizationPersonalization has become a critical component of ecommerce success. It’s a relatively straightforward way to offer shoppers what they want when purchasing from an online store.Personalization is a powerful tool for brands and retailers but it must be executed carefully to be most effective.If done well (and this means unobtrusively and throughout the customer journey), personalization poses a huge opportunity to really connect with each type of customer within your client’s audience. This is especially true for smaller merchants who can make fast decisions and are flexible to experiment.So, keep the above advice in mind when supporting your merchants on their personalization journey and you’re well on your way to helping them increase their conversions."
7,"Augmented reality (AR) poses a huge opportunity for brands to create more engaging customer experiences online, address changing shopping behaviors, and boost conversion rates while reducing return rates—all at the same time.AR ecommerce enables customers to virtually try on and test products through their digital device, which helps them make better purchasing decisions. For example, customers can preview what products such as furniture will look like in their homes or—in the case of clothing, jewelry, and beauty products—on their bodies before ordering them.While AR has been around for a while, the technology has become easier to integrate, and there are a lot more devices an AR ecommerce experience can work on than ever before: By 2024 there will be an estimated 1.7 billion mobile AR user devices worldwide, according toa recent report by Statista.Jason Stokes, founder and CEO of Shopify Plus agencyEastside Co, saysthe technology is gaining traction in ecommercespecifically as online businesses see the benefits it can bring: “In lieu of customers being in a physical shop with a real-life product to view, AR bridges that gap.”In lieu of customers being in a physical shop with a real-life product to view, AR bridges that gap.Jason Stokes, Founder and CEO, Eastside Co.Stokes explains that, fromIkea’s AR appthat lets you try a table for size in your dining room toSpecsavers’ functionalitythat allows you to try on virtual glasses, merchants are beginning to see how AR can increase conversion rates and minimize returns.In this article, you’ll learn how to build effective AR ecommerce experiences for your merchant clients, including best practices for both creating 3D models and integrating AR into ecommerce stores.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success. Join for free and access educational resources, developer preview environments, and recurring revenue share opportunities.Sign upHow AR can help merchants boost conversion ratesA recent studyhas shown that customers who used AR while visiting an ecommerce site spent around 20% more time browsing and viewed 1.28 times more products compared to customers who didn’t use AR. Crucially, their likelihood of making a purchase during their session also went up by almost 20%.Thepotential conversion lift for merchantsthat add AR to their online stores is therefore significant, as demonstrated by two case studies of merchants who collaborated with Shopify PartnerModelry:Rebecca MinkofWhen fashion brandRebecca Minkof adopted the use of 3D modeling and ARon its product pages, the company found that shoppers who interacted with a 3D model were 44% more likely to add it to their cart and 27% more likely to place an order than those who hadn’t, and when customers viewed a product—like a handbag—in AR and virtually placed it in front of them, they became 65% more likely to make a purchase.To implement augmented reality technology on their ecommerce site, Rebecca Minkoff collaborated with Shopify Plus and 3D product visualization expert Modelry (Source:Modelry).Gunner KennelsDirect-to-consumer companyGunner, which specializes in heavy-duty kennels that keep pets safe during transportation, experienced a similar conversion boost.Gunner added Shopify’s native support for 3D models and ARto its site, enabling shoppers to virtually place a kennel beside their dog to gauge its size. As a result, the company experienced a 3% increase in cart conversions, a 40% increase in order conversions, and a 5% reduction in returns.Shoppers can use Gunner’s AR functionality on their smartphone to check if they’re choosing the right size kennel for their pet (Source:Shopify Plus).So, how can you support merchants in considering AR in their strategy and in implementing effective AR experiences on their ecommerce stores? We asked a few Shopify Partners, including app developers and AR experts, for their tips to help you get started. Let’s first take a look at how to create a 3D model of your client’s product—an essential part of any AR experience.Best practices for creating a 3D modelTo create an effective AR experience for your client, you first need a 3D model of the product you’d like to showcase. This 3D model can then be uploaded to the merchant’s product page to be viewed and interacted with by customers—without the need to download an additional app.Theoretically, merchants could just create their own 3D models.“There are scanning tools that claim you can just take a few photos of a product and BAM!, a beautiful 3D model is made,” cautionsDaniel Beauchamp, principal AR/VR engineer at Shopify. “But that’s not always the case. The models that are produced with these tools normally need to be cleaned up and aren’t always best suited for ecommerce use cases, when you want the product to look as crisp as possible.”Other merchants turn to marketplaces for freelance services like Fiverr but Maël Valma, founder and developer at Shopify PartnerAngle 3D(whose Shopify appAngle 3D Configuratorprovides merchants with a 3D product customization and AR experience), warns that the 3D artists on some freelance platforms don’t always have the expertise to create 3D models for the web.“Unfortunately, merchants often receive very low-quality 3D models through services like Fiverr,” he says. “Maybe the 3D artists you find on there can build something for a 3D movie or create a static 3D render but often they come back with models that are 1 GB in size, and that just doesn’t work on the web.”The best solution for merchants is tohire a Shopify expert to create a 3D model. So, if you want to help your client with creating a 3D model for an excellent AR ecommerce experience, here are a few points to consider:Try to get access to the physical product to work fromEastside Co’s Jason Stoke points out that getting your hands on the actual product you’re creating a 3D model for can be hugely beneficial.“Sometimes photos just can’t capture the types or feel of materials used in the product and that can be important in making the product look right further on down the line,” he says.Take photos and videos of the product from all anglesReference photos and videos can help capture some details of the surfaces, Stokes explains. Collecting enough information about the product before you start the 3D modeling process ensures visual accuracy as you’ll be able to see components from all sides, and you aren’t working only from written measurements.Begin modeling with simple shapesTaking a low-resolution model and increasing the number of polygons smooths the model out, Stokes advises.A polygon is a geometric shape that is created by connecting three or more line segments into a closed-form, like a square, triangle, or hexagon. In 3D it’s usually triangles, and every model can be divided into a number of polygons—the so-called polygon count or polycount. The smaller the polygons, the smoother the model and the higher the polycount.Optimize your 3D model for the webFor AR experiences on online stores you need a high-quality 3D model that is also optimized and compressed.“On Shopify, there’s a size limit for 3D models and that’s for a very good reason because it needs to load really fast on the website,” says Angle 3D’s Maël Valma. “It also still needs to look good, so it’s a trade-off between quality and size.”In general, the file size of a 3D model for a Shopify merchant is typically around 4 MB and shouldn’t exceed 15 MB.Here are a couple of ways to optimize the file size of a 3D model:Keep the 3D model's polycount as low as possibleEven though the smartphones we now carry in our pockets are incredibly powerful computing devices, Stokes warns that they would have a very hard time rendering millions of polygons all at once. Because augmented reality renders the model in real time, it’s important to keep the polygon count at manageable levels while maintaining all the details of the product.“The key is to find the balance, so that the 3D model is still smooth,” Valma recommends. “Most of the time reducing the polygon count is the solution that significantly decreases the size of the 3D model.”Create high-quality, optimized texturesThe second thing Valma always suggests to his customers is to work on the textures. Ideally, these should be JPEGs as they are less heavy and can be compressed without affecting the quality of the image.Modern-day, real-time renderers export textures using a workflow called physically based rendering (PBR).“This means that the lighting and rendering engine tries to accurately map the way light behaves when hitting the surface of a model based on the material of that surface,” Stokes explains. “Modern texturing software such asSubstance Painterhas made creating realistic materials very easy.”Textures consist of several layers to indicate characteristics such as roughness and metalness.“3D is all about tricking the eye,” Valma says. “So each of these layers is included in the 3D model, and the more textures you have and the more complex they are, the more it will increase the size of the model, which will slow down the loading of the 3D model.”To optimize each layer, Valma suggests striking a balance between reducing the texture resolution and compressing the file, depending on the 3D model you’re working with.“It’s best practice to ensure your textures are square and sized to the power of two, so for example 512 x 512 pixels, “Valma explains. “A 4096 x 4096 dimension would be a 4k texture, which is really high-definition and looks amazing but won’t perform well. Generally, we work with 2k textures, so 2048 x 2048 pixels. Experiment with the size and check if the textures still look good.”To learn more about the standards that you need to keep in mind when creating 3D models for merchants, refer tothe guide in Shopify’s help centeranduse this checklistto make sure that a 3D model is ready to be delivered to a merchant or a 3D partner.The progress of an AR project Eastside Co worked on recently, from rough polygons……to adding more detailed polygons……to creating a render of the 3D model……to how the 3D model appears in the AR experience (Source:Eastside Co).Best practices for integrating AR into ecommerce storesOnce the 3D model has been created, you need to integrate it into the AR experience of the merchant’s online store. Again, there are several best practices to consider to optimize its impact.It’s important to note thatmost Shopify themes support 3D models out of the box, enabling you to offer an in-browser 3D experience that works in all modern browsers and devices, which allows zooming, spinning, and the inspection of every little detail. For these features to appear on the front-end of the merchant’s store, you might need to update their theme to be able to upload 3D model files through the product section of the Shopify admin.So whether you’re using Shopify’s native support or customizing the experience, what do you need to keep in mind?Shopify Plus agencyWe Make Websitesrecently worked with toy company Hasbro on a temporary AR experience that enabled customers to view how collectables would look in their own space to make informed purchasing decisions.Reflecting on the lessons the team learned from the project, We Make Websites’ design and experience director Kerrin Meek says: “The key to successful ecommerce design is ensuring the experience is user-friendly, accessible, and adds value to the customer journey. It should be intuitive, easy to use, and work on multiple devices to maximize the benefits of the technology.”The key to successful ecommerce design is ensuring the experience is user-friendly, accessible, and adds value to the customer journey. It should be intuitive, easy to use, and work on multiple devices to maximize the benefits of the technology.Kerrin Meek, Design and Experience Director, We Make WebsitesIf you create a custom experience, the technical integration of AR into the ecommerce platform must also be done with consideration to avoid any negative impact on website performance, Meek adds. To make the process easier, keep the experience simple and focused on value, balancing form and function. And if you use Shopify’s built-in 3D functionality, it already supports lazy loads and has little impact on website performance.Shopify Plus partner agencyDisco Labs, meanwhile, recently worked with merchant The Sheet Society to design and implement theirBed Builder. The project gives customers the ability to mix and match a wide range of color, design, and material options to create the ideal bedding setup for their home. On a smartphone, customers can use the camera to preview what the various combinations would look like on their own bed through an augmented reality experience.The Sheet Society’s Bed Builder uses AR to let customers try out different colors and styles, which gives customers confidence in their purchasing decision, while also reducing potential returns (Source: The Sheet Society).Disco Labs’ founder and CEO Gavin Ballard acknowledged there was some initial apprehension about the scale of the project.“It was our first AR project, and we knew Shopify's native AR support had improved, but we needed to take a custom approach due to the dynamic nature of the bed builder's options,” he explains. “We had eight products in 10 sizes, each with eight materials and 20+ color options. This gave us a baseline of over 64 million possible bed configurations, something that wasn’t possible to generate 3D models for in advance!”Disco Labs and The Sheet Society decided to bring AR solutionVarianton board for the Shopify integration. Variant’s dynamic generation technology allowed the team to map all possible component and material options into a single 3D file, and have that file rendered dynamically on demand as customers updated their bundle options.“Once we had Variant up and running, the actual integration into the Shopify front end was actually pretty straightforward,” Ballard remembers. “We just needed to map our existing set of options to the corresponding Variant configuration, write some JavaScript to detect the AR capabilities of the browser being used, and render a link to Variant’s dynamically generated endpoint for AR-capable devices.”Ballard shared his top three takeaways from the project to help you master your own AR integrations:Validate the use case“We knew AR would be a winner for The Sheet Society because of the success of the first phase of the Bed Builder and ongoing customer demand. However, we’ve seen plenty of other AR projects fail as they didn’t validate it was something their customers would actually find useful.”Ensure you have a repeatable work pipeline for updates“Just like any other content, AR content needs to be manageable by the merchant at scale. They can’t be blocked by needing to bring in a developer every time they want to add a new material or color option.”Invest time in making your solution extendable“There’s a fine line between building stuff you’re not going to need and planning for the future. For AR projects, I’d err on the side of spending a little more time than usual thinking about how the system could be extended down the line and ensuring your codebase is flexible enough to adapt.”Adding an AR experience to an online store should be carefully planned. As is the case with every new technology, merchants shouldn’t add it for the sake of it, just because it’s trendy, but work with partners to make sure the medium is right for the project. Once the value of adding AR to the strategy has been established, the focus should be firmly on the user experience as well as workflows that enable merchants to update and extend the AR experience in the future.Creating a more engaging shopping experience for merchantsAs the technology is becoming more sophisticated and smartphones more powerful, AR experiences will become more affordable for merchants of all sizes. Especially for direct-to-consumer brands, a virtual try-on or view-in-place experience can be a decisive factor in a customer’s purchasing decision. Not only does it make shopping more fun, but it also helps the customer to shop with more confidence.The time is right to educate your clients about the potential of integrating AR experiences in their online stores. Carefully consider the value it can provide to customers, following the best practices outlined in this article, and AR can give your clients or users a competitive edge and make a significant difference to their bottom line.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success.

8,"Section groups is a new feature that levels up theme architecture. Before the introduction of this new feature, Sections Everywhere were not everywhere—you could not add a section or app in the header and footer area of a theme.This resulted in limited design flexibility from the editor and forced merchants and apps to edit and inject code in the theme which took them off the theme upgrade path. This opened up the merchant to a whole host of potential problems, such as not being able to get bug fixes and new features.With section groups, those concerns are no more. In this article, we take a look at what section groups are, how they work, and how you can leverage them in your theme design.What are section groups?Section groups enable theme developers to create dynamic conglomerations of sections in a theme layout. In other words, they enable you to group certain sections together in your theme. This in turn allows merchants to add, remove, and reorder sections directly in the theme editor.This functionality is created in the theme’s sections directory and rendered in the theme’s layout files via the{% sections %}Liquid tag.Code snippet intheme.liquidwhere section groups are being added.Screenshot of the sections folder in a theme withfooter-group.jsonandheader-group.json.Section groups also open the opportunity to build features for the header and footer areas of a merchant’s theme withtheme app extensions, and is a way to add capabilities (like apps) to any other section groups that are created.By offering merchants additional levels of control directly from the theme editor, they no longer need to inject code into their theme to achieve what they need to. It also gives you more control over the look of your theme and more in-depth customization abilities.In the after screenshot below, you can see the new “Add section” option below the header section and above the template in the theme editor, allowing for sections to be added and reordered above the template.Before and after screenshots of the theme editor showing the new “Add section” option above the template.In addition to the header example above, section groups are also available in the footer group, as well as any other section groups you decide to create.Why use section groupsSection groups come with some major benefits for theme developers and merchants.1. Merchants gain the flexibility to add sections everywhereSections can be added in the header, footer, and aside groups, which hasn’t been possible until now. Merchants can add sections above the header and below the footer and customize or reorder the sections within the section groups. In addition to that, sections can be reordered or removed from the theme editor without the need to change code.2. Theme developers can build more customizable themesYou can now offer a range of sections that can act as headers or footers for merchants to choose from. This gives you and merchants more flexibility in terms of the look of their theme and store.Moreover, merchants can add sections that are rendered on all pages automatically, instead of having to re-add a section template by template. With the use of section groups, any section added to the group will repeat across all templates.3. Apps can integrate with themes without modifying theme codeThis new feature brings the power ofapp blocksto areas such as the header and footer, and any other section groups you create, which means merchants can easily integrate third party apps into themes without modifying theme code. Apps can also now target specific theme section groups (such as the header, footer, or aside).How section groups workSection groups are available to all themes since its announcement at theShopify Winter '23 Edition. If you are familiar with statically-rendered sections, then you will also be familiar with the way section groups are organized and integrated into themes. Below, we take a look at the required changes in order to replace statically-rendered sections such as headers and announcement bars with a section group.Comparison of the theme architecture before and after adopting section groups. The new theme architecture shows how section groups, highlighted in purple areas, contain lists of sections.Theme structureSection groups are JSON formatted files that are located alongside Liquid sections in the sections directory of the theme. Each theme can have up to 20 section group files in the sections directory.In the above example, bothfooter-group.jsonandheader-group.jsonin the/sectionsdirectory are section groups. When it comes to naming these section groups, we recommend you name them after the storefront areas they represent, or after the type of sections they would group. We also recommend using the “-group” prefix in the file names to indicate that the file is a section group. This convention makes it easier to distinguish between Liquid section files and section groups.The purple areas reflect section groups named after the storefront areas they represent.Each section group contains a list ofsectionsand section settings. In other words, they are data files that the mechant can easily manage using the theme editor the same way they managejson templates.Let's take a look at the content in theheader-group.jsonsection group. The below example shows a section group that contains the settings data for two sections: header and announcement-bar.As you can see, section group json data shares a structure very similar to the one used injson templates. Let’s first examine the fields that are shared in both json templates and section groups:<Online store theme editor sections panel showing how the section group’s name property is used.Name:A required field that represents the name of the section group. This name will be displayed in the theme editor, when the section groups are rendered as part of the page. This field also accepts atranslation referencethat makes the name translatable.Sections:An object that uses section IDs as keys and section data as values. You can leave this attribute empty.Theformat of the section datais the same as the section data insettings_data.json. Each section group can accept up to 25 Liquid sections.Order:An array of section IDs, listed in the order that they should be rendered. The IDs must exist in the sections object.Now, let’s look at the fields that are allowed in section groups.Type:Each section group must use one of the standard section group types:HeaderFooterAsideBeside these standardized section groups type, we understand that each theme can have its own layout design, constraints, and use cases, which in return could impact the role each section group plays in the theme. Therefore, theme developers can also create custom section types based on their needs using the following convention:custom.<type-name>How to render section groupsNow that we have a section group created and saved in the sections directory of the theme, we can start integrating it with our theme layout code using thesectionsLiquid tag. Section groups can only be integrated intotheme layoutfiles, which will allow section groups to get rendered on all templates using that layout. In order for a section group to be rendered in a layout file, such aslayouts/theme.liquid, we can simply reference the name of the section group file without the .json extension inside asectionsLiquid tag. For example, take our below theme structure:We can simply referencefooter-groups.jsonandheader-group.jsoninside thelayout/theme.liquidfile:{% sections ""header-group"" %}
{% sections ""footer-group"" %}Using a separate Liquid tag to integrate and render section groups gives you additional flexibility:No restrictions on how theme layouts are designed and structuredEach section group can easily be styledLet’s take a look at howDawnreplaced statically rendered sections with section groups in thelayout/theme.liquidfile:The difference in thetheme.liquidfile in the Dawn theme showing the process of replacing statically-rendered sections with section groups.How to control what sections can be added to a sections groupAs the famous quote says, with great power comes great responsibility. Section groups bring a lot of flexibility and control for merchants to design their storefronts. It allows merchants to add, remove, and reorder sections freely inside these section groups. And since section groups are rendered on all pages, we want to make sure you are able to guide merchants when it comes to building the best storefronts. Because of this, we deprecated the theme section templates attribute and replaced it with two new, more powerful and extendable attributes:enabled_onanddisabled_on.With these new theme section attributes, you can control where each section can be inserted via the theme editor, consequently preventing the merchant from adding sections in places that they are not supposed to be inserted.The left image shows how the featured collection and featured product sections are available for the header section group. The right image shows how the newenabled_onanddisabled_onsection properties make the featured collection and featured product sections unavailable for merchants to insert in the header section group.Let’s take the simple featured product section as an example.Scenario 1: The section can be added to all templates and all section groupsSince the section did not use any of the attributes—enabled_on,disabled_on, ortemplates—the section will automatically be available for insertion to all templates and section groups.This also equivalent to saying:{
""enabled_on"": {
  ""templates”: [""*""],
  ""groups”: [""*""]
}Scenario 2: The section cannot be added to password templates, however it can still be added to all section groupsWe can see how easy it is to disable a section on certain templates using thedisabled_onsection attribute. This will prevent the merchant from accidentally adding the section to the password template.Scenario 3: The section cannot be added to password templates nor header groupsWith this configuration, we can make sure the merchant does not add the simple featured product to the password template or the header groups.Migrating merchant customization automatically during theme upgradeWe understand that merchants have already customized their statically-rendered sections such as the header and footer sections in older themes. We introduced a mechanism to automatically migrate the merchant's settings to ensure a seamless experience when updating to a theme that uses section groups.In other words, when a theme is being updated, we check for all section types referenced in the section groups of the new version, and try to find and match customization in thesettings-data.jsonconfig of the old version.The update process automatically copies statically-rendered sections customizations from the old version of the themes to the section groups of the new version of the themes.The update process automatically copies statically-rendered sections customizations from the old version of the theme to the section groups of the new version based on the section type.However, this update only happens when the merchant upgrades a theme from a version that does not have section groups to a new version in which section groups exist.Section groups use casesThis new functionality opens up numerous possibilities to build interesting solutions and highly customizable themes for merchants.1. Make your theme header, footer, and sidebars customizable, flexible, and extendableOne of the main use cases of section groups is making certain areas of the theme layout customizable, flexible, and extendable. Our data reflected that many of the code changes tolayout/theme.liquidfile was to add and remove a statically-rendered section or integrate a third party app into the header and footer area of the theme. By converting these areas into section groups, we’re giving the merchant full control via the theme editor and without the need to edit code.Comparison of a theme layout with and without section groups. The purple groupings show how theme developers can create customizable areas such as headers, footers, and sidebars.2. Group related sectionsAnother interesting use case that section groups can support is grouping related sections that don’t belong to theme header and footer groups. We allow you to define section groups of custom types and have theme sections that are only supported in such sections. Let’s take following as an example of a such group section:Section groups can group related sections. Combined with the section’senabled_onanddisabled_on properties, these related sections can only be inserted in certain sections.With this configuration, the merchant can remove these system sections, or add new ones anytime they wish using the theme editor and without any code modifications. At the same time, you can maintain the integrity of the system of your design by making sure such sections are only supported in the custom group type.Level up your themeSection groups allow you to break the theme layout down into extensible and flexible groups that merchants can customize using theme sections and app blocks. By replacing the statically-rendered sections with section groups, merchants will be able to manage and customize the sections and blocks inside these groups via the theme editor and without the need to edit theme code.Section groups also allow apps to integrate into theme layouts seamlessly and without any code injections. All these benefits give merchants more flexibility and control over their themes, while leveling up theme architecture for developers.Graphics by Chaz Moore."

10,"Ads on the Shopify App Storelaunched in February 2020to provide a new way for app developers to accelerate their business growth by directly advertising to merchants looking for apps. For those taking advantage of this new channel, learning how to optimize ads in the Shopify App Store is the key to finding success.In this article, we discuss the different considerations to take into account when planning an ad campaign for the Shopify App Store.How ads workBefore we dive in, let’s take a quick refresher on how ads in the Shopify App Store work.Advertisers compete in an auction on specific keywords to serve ads to merchants searching those keywords.When you create an ad, you specify which keywords you want to bid on. When a merchant searches for that keyword in the app store, an auction occurs with all participating apps who bid on that same keyword. The winner(s) of that auction gets to show their ad to that merchant.A cost is only incurred if a user clicks on the ad, and the cost per click is the bid amount at the time of the auction.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success. Join for free and access educational resources, developer preview environments, and recurring revenue share opportunities.Sign upGetting startedBefore you get started with ads, there are some essentials that you should have ready so that you are clear on what you want to achieve, how you measure results, and how you go about achieving these results.To help make your first foray into ads a bit more fruitful, think about the following three considerations.1. KeywordsDo keyword research. This is really important because this determines your starting point for optimization—for example, do you already know what keywords your customers are searching for or is there some discovery still remaining?Choosing strong keywords to bid on means understanding what kind of terms and phrases your potential users search for in the app store. To figure that out, you’ll need to understand your users’ needs and problems at every stage of the conversion funnel, so you can figure out how to best target users at each level.The conversion funnelThe conversion funnel is a way of visualizing the steps a user goes through before deciding to buy (or in this case, install) your product. A simple example of a conversion funnel looks like this:The conversion funnel with the three basic stages: awareness, consideration, and conversion.At the first stage, users have a specific problem they want to solve and are looking at different ways they can solve that problem. At this stage, you’re really just looking to become one of the potential solutions your user considers.At the second stage, users have a set of features they’d like to learn more about, and are searching for more information about those specific features.At the third and final stage, users have a clear idea of what they’re looking for, and are looking for more information specifically about those offerings.For an in-depth look at how the funnel affects how you market your app, read our article onhow to get more downloads in the Shopify App Store.Users at different stages of the funnel search for different information, which means that depending on the stage you choose to target, your keywords will change. As an example, let’s look at Shopify. Business owners search different things, depending on how seriously they’re considering using Shopify. Some examples of keywords for each of the three stages of the funnel could be:Awareness: online store, ecommerce, selling online, online salesConsideration: shipping online orders,online payments, online store competitorsConversion: Shopify pricing, Shopify free trial, Shopify monthly planConductingmarket research for your appwill help you get closer to your users and better understand the terms they may be searching for at every level of the funnel.Leverage dataIn addition to considering the conversion funnel, you may be able to find promising keywords from the data generated by your website, other analytics platforms, and your app listing. While these sources likely won’t translate perfectly to success with app store ads, they will provide guardrails and inspiration for further keywords you can leverage.The following tools can help you with this research:Google Search Console: Visibility into what keywords are bringing people to your websiteGoogle Ads Keyword Planner: Tool to research potential keywordsGoogle Analytics: Visibility into what terms merchants across different markets are searching in the Shopify App Store before they arrive at your app listing (as long as you have an existing app listing and haveadded your Google Analytics ID)You might also like:7 Insights From the Shopify App Review Team to Set Your App Up for Success.2. BudgetAn important facet of planning your ad campaign is figuring out how much you’re comfortable spending. When you’re starting out without any historical performance data, the best way to get familiar with ads is to set aside some money to experiment with, and increase or decrease the amount as you exceed or underperform expectations.As you start to get results on how many installs you acquire at what cost, you can start to make more long term adjustments to how much you should spend.If this is your first time advertising on the Shopify App Store, you might be eligible for a $100 ad credit to get you started.Learn more and claim your credit.3. Key performance indicators (KPI)In the section on objectives above, we discussed choosing your goals for your ad campaign, and how that ties into how you measure success. Charting your KPIs in advance means that you’ll be ready to gauge whether your ad campaign has been successful.If the objective is user growth, you probably want to look at Cost per Install (CPI) and start developing a performance benchmark for the keywords that you are bidding on. That is, keep track of your lowest and highest CPI ads/keywords, as well as your overall average CPI.If the objective is customer growth, you’ll want to look at your Customer acquisition cost (CAC). Similar to the CPI objective above, start developing a historical performance benchmark. Look at where your average sits, and what factors are contributing to high or low CAC.If the objective is to improve Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), similar to the above two, you’ll want to start building your own performance benchmarks. The key difference with ROAS is that you are aiming for higher ROAS rather than lower costs (CPI and CAC).How to interpret performance metricsOn theAdspage in the Partner Dashboard, you have access to visibility, average position, CPI, CAC, ROAS, spend amount, volume of impressions, clicks, and installs metrics broken down by country. You can also export this data as a CSV. Each metric tells you something different about the performance of your ads. Below, we look at each of these metrics.1. VisibilityThe visibility metrictells you how often you’re winning a position on the first page in auction. Generally speaking, you’ll want higher visibility where possible. Higher visibility means getting your app in front of more merchants on the first page, which means more opportunities for clicks and installs.Typically, visibility is correlated with bid amount and relevance, but other factors can make 100 percent visibility not possible for certain keywords. These factors include relevance, overlapping bids, and others. If you’re getting an average position of one, but your visibility isn’t increasing no matter how high you bid, chances are the bid is not the limiting factor.2. Average positionThe average position metrictells you which position in the search results you appear on average. Like visibility, this is correlated with bid amount and relevance, but unlike visibility, there are no additional factors that prevent advertisers from achieving an average position of one.It’s important to keep your CPI in mind when you look at and make adjustments to bids and keywords for the sake of improving average position. A good average position does not guarantee a good CPI, so you’ll want to strike the right balance between good average position and CPI.For example, an average position of two may yield the same CAC or CPI as an average position of one. In such a case, it may not be worth it to bid the amount needed for first position. You’ll need to experiment with your bids and monitor results to see if this is true for your particular app and keywords.Bid suggestionsBid suggestionsare the approximate bid that is required for your app to be competitive in auction. For exact match keywords, the bid suggestion represents the bid range required for a first page auction win. For broad match keywords, the bid suggestion represents a measure of competitiveness against other advertisers. Because broad match keywords match so many different search terms, actual performance in terms of average position and visibility may vary greatly.Use these bid suggestions to help guide your bid setting in each of your target countries. They do not guarantee results, but are meant to give you a more accurate starting point to better performance. Remember: you may be more successful running ads with different targets and bid amounts to account for regional bid differences.3. Cost per install (CPI)If the objective of running ads is to grow your user base, CPI is likely one of the most important metrics. Compare your actual CPI to your historical CPI range, and you have the direct measure of how your ads are performing relative to your own benchmark.Look at where your average CPI falls in your range. What you want to see is your average CPI sitting at the lower end of your range. If not, you’ll want to identify which ads or keywords are high cost and make the requisite adjustments or optimizations (detailed later in this article).For accounts with a lot of history that have been heavily optimized, it’s okay if the CPI sits in line with your average vs. at the lower end of the range.4. Customer acquisition cost (CAC)If the objective of running ads is to grow your paying customer base, CAC is likely one of the most important metrics for you. Like CPI above, use your historical benchmark to identify if some of your ads or keywords are high cost, and adjust accordingly.Because customer data is reported against the date the ad impression was served, when looking at CAC performance, it’s best to look at data older than 60 days to account for the lag in customer conversion times.5. Return on ad spend (ROAS)If the objective of running ads is to maximize the efficient revenue acquisition, ROAS is likely one of the most important metrics. Compare your actual ROAS to your historical ROAS range, and you have the direct measure of how your ads are performing relative to your own historical performance.Look at where your average ROAS falls in your range. What you want to see is your overall ROAS sitting at the higher end of your range. If not, you’ll want to identify which ads or keywords are low ROAS and make the requisite adjustments or optimizations (detailed later in this article).For accounts with a lot of history that have been heavily optimized, it’s okay if ROAS sits in line with your average vs. at the higher end of the range. Because revenue data is reported against the date the ad impression was served, when looking at ROAS performance, it’s best to look at data older than 60 days to account for the lag in customer conversion times.6. Spend amount or install volumeCPI the metric by which you measure your success, but by itself, it can lack context. That’s where the spend amount or install volume comes in.Some keywords can have very low or very high CPI, but represent only a small fraction of your total spend or total installs. Ideally you want to see both a high install volume or spend amount, and a low CPI on the keyword or search term. Bid adjustments made to your largest spend and highest install volume keywords tend to have the largest impact. See a comparison of two example results below.In the above example, the keyword with the greatest amount of spend (logos) is the one that has the highest number of installs at the lowest CPI.In the example above, the keyword with the lowest CPI has only $482.35 (review) of spend against it.You might also like:Tips for Creating Effective Technical Documentation for Your Shopify App.Identifying poor results and what optimizations to makeIn this section, we provide some examples of what poor results look like, and what you can do to improve them.Low visibilityBy itself, the low visibility metric simply shows that you’re not winning a large portion of your first page auctions, and in many cases is directly influenced by two factors: your relevance score and your bid. Raising your bid is the most direct way to improve visibility, but as mentioned above, relevance and other factors also impact visibility.It’s best not to make changes based on only low visibility. Instead, you’ll want to look at this metric in conjunction with other indicators, like average position (see below).In the example below, we see that visibility is low for social media icons but that average position is 1.5. In such a case, increasing the bid is not likely going to improve visibility as the average position is already one.In the example below for apparel fulfillment, we see that both visibility and average position are low (50.00 and 5.6 respectively), and relevance is medium. In such cases, increasing your bid is likely to have an impact on visibility.Poor average positionPoor average position is usually defined as the average position of four or greater (average impression showing up on page two or three).Low average position combined with low visibility and medium or better relevance likely means that your bid is not high enough. You can increase your bid to try and improve both. If you’re able to get a first page average position and visibility, this can lead to improved performance as you have much greater visibility with merchants.In the example below for wishlist, we see that there is an average position of 4.7, a visibility of 12.2%, and high relevance. Increasing the bid is likely to have a significant impact on average position.In the example below for advanced wishlist, a high average position (1.2) combined low visibility (40%) and low relevance (see image below) likely means that your bid is sufficiently high, but other factors prevent visibility from improving. Overlapping bids, or bidding on broad match keywords are two common causes.High CPI or high CACWhen you start to see high overall CPI or CAC (relative to your historical range), it’s a sign that you need to make some optimizations. Some causes and the optimizations you can make include:Continuing to bid on keywords with no installs or customers that have a high spend amount or high impression volume.Each advertiser needs to set their own threshold for what they determine to be sufficient spend or impression volume. The solution here is to pause this keyword or substantially lower the bid as it’s not worth the cost to keep this keyword active.Overpaying for clicks.If your average position is already one or under 1.3, it’s unlikely that increasing your bid further will yield much improvement on CPI or CAC.Relying only onbroad match keywords. This can lead to high CPI or CAC because of all the search terms that often match to a broad match keyword. Identify which search terms for each broad match keyword are driving installs at or below your target cost, and add them to a new campaign as exact match keywords.If you’ve tried experimenting with bids and match types, and still can’t lower your CPI, it might be worth looking at a different set of keywords to see if you are able to acquire installs at a low cost that way.Low ROASWhen you start to see low overall ROAS (relative to your historical range), it’s a sign that you need to make some optimizations. Common causes and the actions to take are very similar to what you would do for high CPI or high CAC:Identify keywords with high spend and low (or no) ROAS.If you’ve spent quite a bit but are still seeing very little ROAS, it’s probably not worth keeping this keyword active.Overpaying for clicks.If your average position is already one or under two, it’s unlikely that increasing your bid further will yield much improvement to ROAS.Relying only onbroad match keywords. This can lead to low ROAS because of all the search terms that often match to a broad match keyword. Identify which search terms for each broad match keyword are driving installs at or below your target cost, and add them to a new campaign as exact match keywords.No impressions servedWhen you’ve added a keyword to an active ad and see zero impressions for a given ad or keyword, there are usually four reasons. Here are some actions you can try to show ads for certain keywords:Very low relevance. Having low relevance does two things: increases the bid required to win auctions, and decreases your ability to participate in auction.Incorrect date ranges selected: The ad was only created on June 2nd, but the date range you’re looking at is May 1 — 31.Low bid: Try gradually raising your bid in controlled increments to see if it’s a low bid that’s causing this.Keyword added as a negative keyword: If you bid on the keyword marketing and have marketing added as a negative keyword, this will prevent any impressions from being served.You might also like:Research 101: How to Conduct Market Research for Your App.Other ways to optimize your adsOutside of the poor results identified above, listed below are some optimizations you can make to improve overall performance.Adding keywordsIf you can’t achieve your target CPI with the keywords you’re currently bidding on, try adding other keywords from your research or from our keyword recommendations (see image below) in the Partner Dashboard and see if you can acquire installs at a lower cost.Reorganize adsIf your ads are constantly out of budget, and you feel your high performing keywords aren’t getting as much of your daily budget, it might be worth reorganizing the way you group your ads so that your best performing keywords get allocated as much budget as possible.The best way to think about this is to organize your ads by performance groupings, and allocate budget according to what performs best, rather than have all of your keywords lumped together in one ad. The thinking is that some keywords perform better than others—you want to isolate and maximize how much budget is allocated to those.For example, dividing your keywords by exact match marketing keywords, exact match Facebook ads, and broad match Facebook ads, like in the image below, helps you funnel more money to the highest performing batch (in this case, exact match marketing keywords).Bundling keywords allows you to allocate budget to the best-performing ones.Leverage geotargetingUse the ads management UI to explore how your campaigns are performing across different countries, including where your ads resonate the most and where you are getting the most value for your investment.Then you can use that information to reorganize your ads intogeotargeted campaignstailored for specific countries and regions, adjusting the keywords, targeting, and daily budget to be most competitive in each market.To maximize regional optimizations, we recommend creating a dedicated campaign for each of your targeted countries. That way you can monitor and adjust bids and keywords according to what is ideal for that country. Simply duplicate an existing campaign, then adjust settings as needed. Don’t worry—both campaigns will retain the historical app and keyword relevance data.Using ads for app store successWe hope this optimization guide was useful, and that you’re able to identify some actionable optimizations for your own campaigns so you can better achieve your growth goals, and improve your overall advertising efficiency.Stay in the knowSubscribe to receive What's New with Shopify, our monthly email featuring Shopify's latest product news.EmailSign me upThanks for signing up!"

In other words, apps that merchants find most relevant, given what they’re searching for, will rank higher overall.Extensive testing has shown that incorporating this new behavioral data markedly improves the relevancy of results for merchants. And while other signals, like term-matching, still inform results, keyword stuffing will now have less of an impact. Over time, this should promote the evolution of better, more readable descriptions across apps.Search now has a built-in mechanism for helping smaller trending apps show up higher in results. It will dynamically increase the ranking of apps that are gaining traction, especially if they are high quality.We're also improving the relevance of the ads merchants see, which could lead to changes in the performance of some campaigns.Search ranking will be more dynamic than it was previously. If you monitor this closely, you can expect more day-to-day variability than before.Developer best practicesAs a developer, there’s nothing you need to do to prepare for optimization updates like these.

14,"At Shopify, we know how critical the checkout is when it comes to converting customers. As a result, we’ve worked tirelessly to ensure that the Shopify checkout is both incredibly fast and easy to use.However, it’s also key that checkout has the flexibility to present the unique experiences, promotions, and features that brands need to entice shoppers, while keeping orders accurate and compliant with the merchant’s policies and regulations. On the marketing side, this means designing a checkout that boosts conversion rates and maximizes the lifetime customer and average order value. When it comes to compliance, brands can ensure that accurate buyer expectations are set and that orders follow the brand’s business rules and any relevant regulations. This is where checkout extensibility comes in.With checkout extensibility, you get the tools, functionality, and deployment model necessary to build tailor-made checkouts for all brands on Shopify Plus. In this article, we dive into the specific technology that you can use to build checkout customizations, as well as some key use cases that they can power.Catch up on the latest developer announcements from the Shopify Winter ’23 EditionThe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition was full of big announcements for developers who work with Shopify. Visit the Shopify Editions website to get caught up on all the product news that impacts your business.Go to EditionsCheckout extensibility is a suite of powerful capabilities that allow developers to customize checkout. These include:Checkout UI extensionsWeb pixel extensionsShopify FunctionsCheckout Branding APIAt theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, we announcednew checkout UI extension capabilities and surface areasthat provide major benefits to both developers and merchants.On the developer side, checkout apps can now be sold directly to Shopify Plus merchants in theShopify App Store, allowing you to broadly distribute them for easy installation and configuration. App-powered checkout extensions are upgrade-safe, higher-converting, and integrated with Shop Pay.In-house developers and agencies also have access to all the same platform capabilities to develop custom apps for specific merchants.Shopify Plus admins can install your app and configure it directly in the newcheckout editor. For admins, this app-based model means they can quickly customize their checkout without ever needing to touch a line of code.10 ways to build a better checkout experience with checkout extensionsNow that you’ve got a high-level understanding of what checkout extensibility means, let’s take a look at how it can help you build unique checkout experiences.1. Set expectations with custom banner messagesWith therising costof new customer acquisition, it’s critical for brands to earn and maintain trust with their customers, especially during the checkout process. This trust will help set clear expectations with buyers and ensure that they have all relevant information before completing a purchase.Custom banner messages allow you to include important information for buyers right on the checkout page, so there are no surprises as they move through the buying process.Common examples of custom banner messages that brands display in checkout include:Sharing which items are not eligible for returns or exchangesHighlighting any potential shipping delaysNotifying buyers about special circumstances to be aware of, such as holiday turnaround timesShowcasing industry-specific trust badges, testimonials, or quotesBy leveragingcheckout UI extensions, you can quickly build multiple versions of custom banners that render at theCheckout::Dynamic::Renderextension point within the checkout. Best of all, you can choose a specific location in checkout for the banner to show, or give merchants the choice to determine where and how these banners should be displayed using the checkout editor.Two different checkout examples, both showing a special field where information like delivery instructions can be noted by the buyer.To get started building a custom banner, visit our developer documentation at the link below.Build a custom banner2. Leverage custom fields to collect additional informationSometimes, to ensure an order can be properly fulfilled, to personalize the customer’s experience, or to satisfy a business compliance rule, you need to collect additional information from the customer in checkout. To help meet these expectations, many brands leverage custom inputs to collect important information from buyers. For example, they might collect:Delivery instructions for apartments or office buildings, like buzzer codesRequests for non-contact deliveriesSpecial care instructions related to the deliveryRequests for sustainable packagingDelivery instructions aren’t the only thing you can do with custom fields. They also allow you to capture additional information so you can better tailor the customer experience for the buyer. Some examples include:Providing gift messages to add a personal touch for the order recipientCollecting voluntary information on a buyer’s preferences to personalize marketingAdding membership or ID numbersCheckout UI extensions can be used to add these special fields, which render at theCheckout::ShippingMethods::RenderAfterextension point.Two different checkout examples, both showing a special field where information like delivery instructions can be noted by the buyer.To get started building custom delivery instructions, visit the link below.Build custom delivery instructions3. Use product upsell offers to increase average order valueThe ability to add upsell offers within the checkout is probably the most popular checkout customization for Shopify Plus merchants. Brands from around the world leverage these checkout upsell messages to help increase average order value and to cross-sell relevant items in a collection, like the space-themed shoes and socks in our example below.At theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, we made checkout upsells even more powerful by allowing you to access theStorefront APIto power the logic behind your upsell. With this capability, you’ll be able to suggest the most relevant items to customers based on the existing product or collection tags from the items in the cart.You can build pre-purchase product offers that render at theCheckout::Dynamic::Renderextension point with checkout UI extensions.An example of a checkout experience with a “You might also like” section, displaying products related to the original purchase.Visit our documentation to get started building a product offer at the link below.Build a product offer4. Highlight important causes with with donation banners and upsellsWith more commerce options than ever before, consumers are increasingly looking to buy from brands that support the environmental, social, and governance causes (known as ESG) that they are passionate about. To help quantify this concern, ESG factors will play a role innearly half of all consumers’purchase decisions.As a result, it’s critical that brands let customers know about the causes they support. It’s even better if a merchant can provide a way for customers to also donate to that cause. That’s where checkout extensibility comes into play. With checkout UI components like custom banners and upsell offers, you can build a donation option that displays at theCheckout::Dynamic::Renderextension point. These donation options can include ways for buyers to support a specific charity or to let them know how much of their purchase is being directed to a specific cause.By including a donation option directly in the checkout flow, customers can quickly understand what causes a brand believes in, and easily add their support.An example of a checkout with a custom banner allowing buyers to add a donation to their purchase.Get started building a donation banner at the link below.Build a donation banner5. Sell to the right customers by validating purchasesAlthough the ultimate goal of the checkout is to convert customers, it’s often necessary that they meet certain qualifications before they’re able to complete a purchase. Ensuring that customers are compliant is especially important when selling items that require an age verification, like liquor or cannabis products.With theCart and Checkout Validation Shopify Function, you can ensure that customers can only complete a purchase if their orders comply with a specific set of rules, determined by the merchant. Field validation can also be performedusing UI extensions. Some of the most common use cases for cart and checkout validation include:Verifying the age of a customerEnforcing character limits to ensure checkout data syncs to external systems properlyRequiring a custom field to be filled out before the customer can check outEnsuring that the item can be delivered to a shipping address that is not a PO boxChecking that the cart doesn’t contain items that shouldn’t be purchased together, like a lighter and lithium batteriesEnsuring the checkout conforms to order minimum or maximumsAn example of a validation rule that ensures customers are the appropriate age before purchasing a product.Visit our developer documentation to build your first validation rule at the link below.Build a checkout validation rule6. Create custom discounts to incentivize buyersOffering unique discount promotions is a key way for brands to attract customers, boost sales, increase cart size, and stand out from the competition. By leveragingShopify Functions, you can build customproduct,order, andshippingdiscounts that automatically display in checkout. As an added bonus, custom discount rules are configured directly in the Shopify admin and can be viewed in Shopify analytics sales reporting, alongside Shopify’sautomatic discounts.Some common discount ideas that brands have long been interested in include volume discounts based on the number of items purchased, or a free-gift-with-purchase offer when a specific dollar threshold is reached.A custom volume discount on the product page and reflected in checkout.Learn how to build custom discount offers at the link below.Build custom discount offer7. Display payment and shipping methods with payment and delivery customizationsThere’s nothing worse to a brand than seeing a high rate of abandoned carts in the checkout. Although there are many tactics that can help reduce cart abandonment, one of the most successful strategies is to customize the checkout experience to highlight the highest-converting payment options to your customers.With Shopify Functions, brands can appeal to their target customers by displaying unique shipping options that meet a specific set of criteria. For example, a brand could entice local customers with an eco-friendly bike delivery option to buyers who live within a certain distance, determined by ZIP or postal code, from the fulfillment center.When it comes to payment customizations, you can hide, reorder, and present custom payment options to your buyers based on a number of factors. One of the most popular payment customizations includes surfacing a “cash-on-delivery” option to customers, as long as the total value of the order is below a specific threshold.An example of a ‘Cash on Delivery’ option that disappears if the cart value is above a preset threshold.Get started building payment or delivery customizations via the links below.Build payment customizationBuild delivery customization8. Reward your most valuable customers with loyalty redemption programsAs customer acquisition costs surge, it’s more important than ever for brands to focus on customer retention. This is especially true when considering the fact that loyal customers are worth22 times morethan average customers. One of the best ways to boost brand loyalty is to offer special discounts to your most loyal repeat customers.Thankfully, adding loyalty customizations to checkout have never been easier thanks to the newSession TokenandDiscount Code APIfor checkout UI extensions. With the new Session Token API, Shopify provides a signed token that can be verified on an app server. This token can be used by apps to ensure secure loyalty points redemption when combined with applying a Shopify discount code in checkout.Once the buyer’s identity and history has been verified, brands can offer VIP discounts to their best customers.An example of a 20% discount offered to loyal customers.This update also allows for brands to give buyers the option to redeem loyalty points for a discount code at checkout.An example checkout showing buyers the option to redeem loyalty points for a discount.Visit our documentation to start building loyalty customizations at the link below.Build loyalty customization9. Build unique brand and shopping experiencesAs pandemic restrictions around the world loosened in 2021, physical retailgrew fasterthan ecommerce for the first time ever. Compounding this trend,half of generation Z shoppersfavor the in-store experience. In order to combat this shift, brands need to provide a fun and unique online shopping experience.By leveraging the available suite of checkout extensibility capabilities, you can make online shopping fun by:Using metafields to identify and display promotions to your most loyal customersLeveraging theStorefront APIto pull relevant results and personalize free gift offersUse multiple checkout UI components to compose one-of-a-kind experiences unique to your brand, like the trivia question shown belowAn example of a unique checkout experience using a trivia question. If the buyer chooses correctly, they can win a free pair of socks.Start building unique shopping experiences by visiting our docs.Build unique experiences10. Inherit a single look and feel that reflects your styleOne last capability to highlight is that brands can make advanced customizations to the appearance of their checkout with theBranding API. This API allows you to make customizations, from changing the colors and fonts in the checkout to adding your favicon or adjusting the corner radius on buttons.Best of all, this branding is automatically applied to checkout, Shop Pay, and is inherited by checkout extensions installed on the shop. That means you only have to install your app customizations once and don’t need to modify code every time you want to update the look and feel of your checkout extension.Changing the appearance of checkout using the Branding API.To get started branding your checkout, visit our developer documentation.Brand your checkoutCustomizing the checkoutThere are so many unique ways that brands can leverage checkout UI extensions and Shopify Functions to customize the checkout experience, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Since Functions run inline on Shopify’s global infrastructure, they can meet the demands of the biggest sales events on the planet, while still executing in under 5ms.Today, we’re unlocking more areas that can be customized with Functions. Developers can now leverage Functions to build customProduct Bundles,Order Routinglogic, andCheckout Validation rules. When combined with the existing Discounting, Delivery, and Payment customizations, Functions is making Shopify more extensible than ever before.We’re also making the creation of Functions more accessible than ever by announcing support for JavaScript, in addition to other languages that compile to WebAssembly. This language support will make it much easier for the existing developers in the Shopify community to leverage Functions customizations in their apps.To learn more about Functions, check out ourdeep dive on the Shopify Partner Blog.Metafields and metaobjectsWith the introduction of metaobjects, Shopify is unlocking a new paradigm ofdata extensibility. Metaobjects are a flexible way to add, store, and manage additional structured information. This can be information about a Shopify resource, such as a product or a collection, or something completely new. Some examples include product features, specifications, size charts, staff profiles, and complex content.Some key features for developers are the ability to control access of custom object models, such as controlling access for back office or admin use, or controlling whether or not a custom object is available for storefront access. Metaobjects also have mixed reference functionality, allowing for complex and multi-model references.Additionally, apps now have full flexibility to store their app-managed data within Shopify by using a reserved namespace (for metafields and metaobjects), and control how merchants can interact with that data across the admin and within storefronts (Liquid and Hydrogen).Apps also have a greater toolkit for managing custom data, including new rich text, collection reference, and money metafield types, JSON metafield validation schemas, and a customerbirth_datestandard metafield.Today, metaobjects are available in themes using Liquid, Storefront API, and Admin API. Learn more aboutmetaobjectsandmetafieldsin our developer documentation.Checkout UI extensionsAt Shopify, we believe checkout is the most important step in converting customers. While every checkout needs to be lightning-fast and secure, it’s also important that the Shopify platform offers flexibility to build unique checkout experiences, promotions, and custom logic. We’ve already seen you build some awesome apps for product offers, custom fields, banners and more.Today we’re announcing a whole host of new APIs for checkout UI extensions, like the ability to make authenticated network calls, directly query the Storefront API from extensions, and apply discount codes and gift cards. Checkout UI extensions are also now available to all Plus merchants. Together, these APIs will unlock a range of new loyalty and marketing apps. And best of all, you can sell your checkout customizations through theShopify App Store.Learn more about working with Checkout UI extensions with ourarticle on the Shopify Partner Blog.Shopify BlockchainShopify Blockchain will give developers the power to build seamless token-powered experiences that target specific audiences, drive engagement with exclusive perks, and fuel customer loyalty and brand collaboration.More specifically, theGates APIwill allow developers to create custom tokengates for Shopify stores that are enforced at checkout. Merchants can decide which token holders (buyers) get exclusive access to products, perks, and more.Meanwhile, Blockchain components will provide the presentation layer that tokengating apps will need to display gate status and requirements, ensuring that developers can get their app to market as quickly as possible.Lastly, the NFT Sales Eligibility API will let developers verify a merchant's eligibility to mint and sell NFTs on Shopify (via Shopify Payments) using a third party app.Learn more about building with Shopify Blockchainin our developer documentation.Shop MinisShop Minis is a new program that allows developers to build mobile shopping experiences inthe Shop appfor 100 million buyers.

It also includes Checkout UI extensions based on B2B buyer identity, allowing you to build performant and upgrade-safe apps for B2B checkout experiences—such as hiding, reordering, or offering custom shipping and payment options using the Delivery and Payment Functions.Learn more about building B2B apps inour deep dive blog post.Catalogs APITo help developers build apps that enable merchants to create and manage tailored product catalogs and prices for different contexts, we’re introducing the Catalogs API. Using the Catalogs API, you can create a set of rules that determine the available products and their prices in different contexts, such as your unique business customers or regional markets.For example, a business catalog might specify that customers ordering from a specific B2B company entity can purchase only t-shirts from a merchant’s store and at a 30% discount.Learn more about catalogs forB2Bormarkets/internationalizationin our developer docs.Returns and Inventory States APIsTo help you build better back office solutions for Shopify merchants, we are excited to introduce the newReturnsandInventory StatesAPIs. These capabilities allow you to integrate your solution more seamlessly with theShopify admin, giving merchants better data continuity, visibility, and accuracy across platforms.ShopifyQL APIAccess to analytics data is foundational for any successful business. That’s why we built an accessible, commerce-centric data querying language: ShopifyQL. ShopifyQL gives merchants, developers, and partners easy access to data specifically modeled for business explorations. The language comes packed with powerful features like easy-to-learn syntax, one-step data visualization, built-in period comparisons, and commerce-specific date functions to make access to data simpler and faster.Developers can take advantage of the Admin GraphQL API endpoints to access ShopifyQL and the underlying datasets.To learn more about using ShopifyQL, check out theShopifyQL documentationand the GraphQLAPI documentation.Web and server pixelsBuilding a data layer to observe and use customer behavior is a strategy that almost every mature merchant is looking to unlock. Now withweb pixelsandserver pixelsin Shopify, tracking customer events between Shopify and marketing or analytics platforms has never been easier, more accurate, or more secure. This is now available with Shopify’s checkout extensibility.The newweb pixel extensionwill unlock more digital surface area for customer behavior analysis, while increasing customer events accuracy and tools for privacy compliance. This update enables developers to add pixels for all merchants, not just merchants on Shopify Plus plans. You can programmatically subscribe to customer events like product views, cart updates, searches, checkouts, post purchase pages, and more. Eliminate or minimize the effort for merchants to add tracking code with this new extension that even comes with a direct integration to Shopify’s privacy and compliance framework.Server pixelsensure better accuracy and efficiency in ad match-rates and ad-spend for merchants. Today this is only available to a limited group of partners, including Pinterest and Meta, but results are already surpassing expectations. Over Black Friday/Cyber Monday, Pinterest tracked the impact of the server pixel implementation on their app and saw increased efficiency for merchant ads. Cost per acquisition (CPA) was 22% lower for merchants with the server-pixel-integrated app.Together, these client-side (web pixels) and server-side (server pixels) data integrations will enable merchants to improve marketing efficiency and accuracy in a secure way.Built by developers for businesses of all sizesThe Shopify platform is always evolving.

16,"At Shopify, we know how important the checkout is when it comes to converting customers. It needs to be lightning fast and secure, while still providing the flexibility to build unique promotions that convert customers.That’s whereShopify Functionscome into play. With Functions, you can customize Shopify’s backend logic to build everything from checkout validation rules to product bundles that display right in the checkout. Best of all, Functions are deployed via apps and can be distributed through theShopify App Store. In this article, we dive into some of the recent enhancements that we’ve made to Shopify Functions, announced at theShopify Winter ’23 Edition.Catch up on the latest developer announcements from the Shopify Winter ’23 EditionThe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition was full of big announcements for developers who work with Shopify. Visit our roundup on the Shopify Partner Blog to get caught up on all the news.Read articleWhat are Shopify Functions?The Function itself is a WebAssembly module that contains custom business logic, such as a product bundle (see below). Functions can be written in any language that supports WebAssembly.To make it even easier to build Functions in Rust, we recently published a new Rust library that drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write, allowing you to focus on writing Functions business logic instead of worrying about API implementation.Writing a Product Bundle.But that’s not all. We heard the feedback from the developer community loud and clear, and Functions can also now be written in JavaScript. This update will make Functions much more accessible. You can learn more about the update and provide feedback on JavaScript Functions in thisblog post.Beyond product bundles, you can also use Functions to create specific discounting logic, like volume or tiered discounts, as well as build your own custom delivery and payment rules to hide, reorder, or present new options within the checkout. We’ve even created acollectionin the Shopify App Store to highlight discount apps that are powered by Functions.An example of a volume discount—buy two or more and get 20% off—powered by Functions.New Shopify Functions APIsAt theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, we announced developer previews for three new Functions APIs: Product Bundles, Cart and Checkout Validations, and Order Routing. These new APIs enable developers to solve many more unique commerce use cases. Let’s dive into each new Function API to understand what it does and what merchant use case it can help solve.1. Cart Transform API (Developer preview)With the Cart Transform Function API, developers can give merchants the ability to create unique bundle offerings. There are two key parts to this. First, the Cart Transform Function allows brands to configure which specific products can be merged into a bundle. These items are then displayed as a new bundle price within the checkout when the correct individual products are combined.In addition, the Cart Transform Function can also expand a bundle product into its individual components, making it easier to complete tasks on the backend—like calculating taxes, shipping weights, decrement inventory, and more—as well as ensuring each individual item is fulfilled appropriately after a purchase.To learn more about the Cart Transform API,visit our developer documentation.The Cart Transform API grouping specific products into a bundle.2. Cart and Checkout Validation API (Developer preview)The Cart and Checkout Validation API ensures customers can only complete a purchase and checkout if their orders comply with a specific set of rules, determined by the merchant. Some of the most common use cases for cart and checkout validation include:Ensuring the customer meets the minimum or maximum quantity requirements to check out. For example, during a hyped sneaker drop, a brand could set a rule that only allowed customers to buy one pair of shoes to minimize reselling.Checking that the shipping address can be shipped to and is not a PO box.Making sure the cart doesn’t contain items that can’t be purchased together, such as a lighter and lithium batteries.The Cart and Checkout Validation API blocking the purchase of more than one pair of sneakers.The Cart and Checkout Validation API also work together with our recently announcedGates APIto powertokengated commerce experiences. Practically speaking, this means that buyers would need to present the correct token to unlock exclusive collections, to receive special discounts, or to check out.Learn more about the Cart and Checkout Validation APIin the docs.3. Order Routing API (Developer preview)There are many variables to consider when determining how to best fulfill and ship orders. For example, does a brand have a warehouse that needs to prepare certain items, or is it better to ship items from the closest location no matter the circumstance? With the Order Routing API, developers can help brands create the order routing logic that best aligns with their businesses.For example, brands could set a topline rule to avoid split-fulfillments, along with a secondary rule to send items from the closest location to the shipping address. This logic means that before completing a shipment, Shopify would determine what fulfillment location had everything in stock and then pick the closest warehouse to the customer.This example is just the tip of the iceberg—developers can create a number of new rules depending on the complexity of the merchant. For example, keeping orders within the country, balancing inventory levels to prioritize locations with more items in stock, or shipping directly from stores, just to name a few.Setting order routing rules, powered by Shopify Functions.Please note that the Order Routing API is currently in developer preview and does not contain a merchant configuration UI. As a result, developers can only test their order routing options within their code.Learn more about the Order Routing APIin our docs.4. Delivery and Payment Customization APIsWith so many unique businesses, markets, and buyer norms, it’s nearly impossible to create delivery and payment options that meet the needs of all the merchants on Shopify. That’s why we’ve released the delivery customization and payment customization Functions. With these Functions APIs, you can hide, reorder, or offer custom delivery and payment options that display right in the checkout.For example, one of the most popular delivery customizations include the ability to surface unique shipping options to specific buyers. We’ve seen brands offer special shipping options, like bike shipping, that only display to customers that live within a certain local area based on ZIP or postal codes. Merchants can also use these new Functions to offer shipping rates that are only available to customers within their country.With regards to payment customizations, one of the most popular use cases is to hide certain payment options based on a dollar threshold. Practically speaking, a merchant may want to offer cash-on-delivery as a payment option, but only up to a specific dollar amount.Setting specifications on payment methods with the Delivery and Payment Customization APIs.For more information, check out our tutorials on building withpayment customizationsanddelivery customizations.Dig deeper into the developer products announced at Shopify EditionsJoin our upcoming Shopify Editions-focused AMA sessions on our Discord channel.

17,"Apps are central to the Shopify platform. Merchants around the world and across industries draw on over 8,000 apps inthe Shopify App Storeto customize their stores and extend their businesses in the way that best suits their needs. Because apps are so critical to their stores’ operations, these merchants need to feel confident choosing, installing, and using apps.That’s why we created Built for Shopify: a program that champions apps built to Shopify’s highest standards for quality, design, and performance. Starting in March, developers can apply for their apps to officially join the Built for Shopify program, the highest level of recognition that an app can achieve, outranking all other highlights and indicating excellence across the board.In this article, we take a look at the details of the Built for Shopify program, and how you can leverage this new opportunity to stand out to merchants and grow your business.Catch up on the latest developer announcements from the Shopify Winter ’23 EditionThe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition was full of big announcements for developers who work with Shopify. Visit our roundup on the Shopify Partner Blog to get caught up on all the news.Read articleThe benefits of being Built for ShopifyTo build a successful app business, you need to find your niche, stand out among your competitors, and continuously maintain a positive reputation. Built for Shopify helps you achieve all these goals by highlighting the high level of quality your app offers to merchants. We’re doing this with three key features.1. Search boostsAs a Built for Shopify app, you can get in front of more merchants with preferential placement inShopify App Storesearch rankings. This means that your app listing will get more visibility and stand out from the competition.2. Easy-to-spot badgeYou can also increase merchant trust with a Built for Shopify badge on your app in various key surfaces, from your app’s listing page to search results and more. This badge is a simple indicator for merchants to quickly recognize apps that are high quality, so they can focus on adding functionality to their store and achieving that next business goal.3. Promotion opportunitiesApps that are Built for Shopify are eligible for promotion in high-converting Shopify surfaces. This includes the Shopify App Store homepage and in the recommended apps section of theShopify admin, making your app more discoverable directly within the spaces that merchants work.Why we’re recognizing apps Built for ShopifyMerchants want apps that are performant, easy to use, reliable, and safe. In fact, merchants have told us that these highlights on app listings influence their decision to install certain apps. While app highlights show the individual elements that your app excels at, Built for Shopify indicates a high bar of quality across the board.Merchants have also told us that finding the right app is challenging. Built for Shopify makes it easier for them to choose apps that meet the needs of their businesses and exceed their expectations for quality, while making it easier for you to demonstrate that your app is a fast, useful, reliable, and easy-to-use choice.Our goal is to make commerce better for everyone—that means both empowering merchants to build their businesses and enabling developers to build incredibly valuable commerce apps. When you invest in a better app experience, we commit to helping you grow your business across Shopify.How to create a Built for Shopify appBy its very nature, Built for Shopify has a high threshold of quality. To make the path to achieving this status clearer for developers, we’ve built a tailored checklist, available in thePartner Dashboard, covering how you can improve your app quality.In this section, we’ll go over the steps to creating a Built for Shopify app Built for Shopify.1. Understand the criteriaThe first step is to visit the Distribution page in yourPartner Dashboardto review the criteria. We’ve broken down the criteria into four key categories:Protect app safety and security. Apps should treat merchant and shop data with care, which means uninstalling cleanly and using specific APIs and extensions.Build for performance. Apps should be optimized for performance, with a fast admin experience and little or no impact on store speed.Design for ease of use. Apps embedded in the Shopify admin orPOSthat have a consistent look, feel, and tone give merchants a seamless and delightful experience.Share app info and benefits. Accurate and updated listing content makes it easier for merchants to quickly understand the value of your app.We’ve built out this page to give you a clear picture of what we’re looking for, and the next steps to get your app there.2. Complete your tasksNext, work through that quality checklist and update your app as needed to make it more performant, easy-to-use, and safe. Each task includes an explanation of why it adds value to merchants, and links out to detailed guidance on how to improve that element of your app.A good early first step is to update your app to use the latest version ofApp Bridge. Using the latest version of App Bridge is a necessary step of improving your app’s performance and following Shopify’s design guidelines. Your app will need to use the latest version of App Bridge for at least 30 days to capture sufficient data on web vital performance, so it’s best to upgrade as soon as possible. We similarly recommend reviewing your app against Shopify’sdesign guidelinesas soon as possible so you can make a plan for necessary improvements.3. Apply for Built for Shopify statusWhen you’ve completed all the tasks, you can apply for Built for Shopify status in yourPartner Dashboardwhen the program officially opens in early March.Ourapp review teamwill then review your app and request further changes as needed. Once your Built for Shopify status is approved, you’ll start getting in front of more potential users when the program rolls out to merchants later this year.Dig deeper into the developer products announced at Shopify EditionsJoin our upcoming Shopify Editions-focused AMA sessions on our Discord channel.

18,"Shopify Checkout has always been built for speed and optimized for conversion. Now, we’re making it more customizable than ever with newcheckout UI extensioncapabilities and surface areas. These updates, announced at theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, make it easier for Shopify Plus merchants to customize their checkout in a way that’s app-based, upgrade-safe, higher-converting, and integrated with Shop Pay.And now, checkout extensibility apps that customize the Shopify Checkout can be sold in theShopify App Storedirectly to Shopify Plus merchants, opening up new opportunities for app developers.In this article, we take a closer look at these new capabilities, and how you can work with them.Catch up on the latest developer announcements from the Shopify Winter ’23 EditionThe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition was full of big announcements for developers who work with Shopify. Visit our roundup on the Shopify Partner Blog to get caught up on all the news.Read articleExisting checkout UI extension capabilitiesPreviously, checkout UI extensions could support a number of customizations, including:Informational use cases, like custom banners, messages, warnings, or disclaimers. For example, adding a banner saying that a brand doesn’t ship to PO boxes.Inputs, like adding additional fields to collect buyer information or customize orders. For example, allowing buyers to add a gift message.Product offers like upsells, free samples, and donations directly in the checkout.Starting now, these capabilities are joined by four new checkout UI extension APIs.An example of the existing customizations available with checkout UI extensions. See the upsell offer for space socks, the additional field for buyers to add a gift message, and the custom banner with the shipping notification.New UI extension points and APIsAt theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, we announced four new checkout UI extension APIs and a developer preview for UI extensions on the order status page. To better understand the value of each of these releases, we’ll walk through each new API and surface area and explain what it does and what use cases can now be solved.Discount Code and Gift Card APIsThe newDiscount Code and Gift Card APIssupport the reading and writing of both discount codes and gift cards directly in the checkout.Practically, this means that brands will be able to allow buyers to redeem their gift cards or discount codes directly in the checkout, and receive confirmation that it was applied to the purchase.An example of a gift card being applied at checkout.Session Token APIToday, Checkout UI extensions can make network calls if they request the necessary permissions. However, there has been no way to sign or verify the authenticity of those network requests. With the newSession Token API, Shopify provides a signed token that can be verified on an app server.One popular app category that will benefit from the Session Token API is loyalty apps. Loyalty reward programs can't just let any user access the balance details of any buyer. Now, they can use the signed token from the Session Token API to verify the buyer's identity. The same is true for any other app that needs or wants security around their services.Loyalty points being redeemed in checkout, thanks to the Session Token API.Querying the Storefront APIYou can now use theStorefront APIto power the logic of your checkout UI extension. This means you’ll be able to pull relevant results for things like product tags and collections, recommended products, or currency conversions. Shopify will manage the access tokens, so all you need to do is provide the query. This direct API is available to all app types, including, for the first time, non-sales channel public apps.Querying the Storefront API to pull product tags allows you to build custom checkout messaging—for example, displaying a message about eco-friendly products.Editor Preview APIWe also recently released anew propertyfor the Checkout UI Extensions API,extension.editor. This property allows you to know whether an extension is running inside thecheckout editoror on a real checkout, and allows you to provide a better in-editor user experience for merchants. Practically speaking, this API will ensure that your UI extension preview works correctly in the checkout editor, so merchants can configure it appropriately.Use the Editor Preview API to make sure a preview is always generated in the checkout editor even when conditions are not met.Order status page (Developer preview)Although we’ve made great progress with app-powered UI extensions directly in the checkout, one area that wasn’t yet customizable with UI extensions was theorder status page. We heard your feedback and at theShopify Winter ’23 Edition, we announced a developer preview for app-powered UI extensions on the order status page. This new surface area will make it much easier for the thousands of merchants leveraging tools like post-purchase surveys to deploy and configure their unique customizations.As a result of this announcement, you can now build extensions that:Generate engagement with social groups, re-targeting, or referral linksHelp better understand buyers with post-purchase or post-fulfillment surveys or reviewsFulfill digital products with download extensionsThese extensions follow the same workflow as our existing checkout UI extensions, only they offer additional APIs to access data post-checkout and can render in a different spot. Order status page UI extensions will also inherit branding, just like with checkout UI extensions. Best of all, merchants will be able download apps from the Shopify App Store and configure them directly in the no-code checkout editor.An example of a digital download on the order status page.Sell your checkout extension app in the Shopify App StoreCheckout extensibility apps that customize the Shopify Checkout can now be sold in theShopify App Storedirectly to Shopify Plus merchants. Gone are the days of needing to work one-on-one with a merchant to develop custom checkout code in thecheckout.liquidtheme file. Instead, Shopify Plus brands can simply download your app and configure it directly in thecheckout editorwithout ever having to touch a line of code. This new model creates the ideal win-win scenario, as merchants can ramp up their checkout much faster with apps, and developers can sell their unique checkout customizations to a much larger audience.Dig deeper into the developer products announced at Shopify EditionsJoin our upcoming Shopify Editions-focused AMA sessions on our Discord channel.

Company APIWhen a merchant engages in B2B transactions, they sell their goods and services directly to other companies. When a company is the customer, there are often multiple contacts, locations, and pre-negotiated payment terms to manage. All of these factors complicate the process of expanding a business into the B2B space.The Business Customers API provides a set of B2B primitives such asCompany,CompanyLocations, andCompanyContacts. These can be used to represent information about who makes a B2B purchase. When selling to B2B customers, merchants need to save different information than they would when selling to DTC customers. For example, a company location must be added to attach important information like tax exemptions and payment terms to the company.Now, developers can add metafields to extend theCompanyandCompanyLocationresources. This creates a flexible way for your app to add and store additional information. This information can be surfaced to merchants or used by your app to create unique business logic such as order value minimums and maximums.The Company API and relations.2. Catalogs API [Unstable]Announced atthe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition, aCatalogis a set of rules that determine the available products and their prices in different contexts.As an example, let’s imagine a merchant who sells packaged food products wholesale in the US and Canada. This merchant may decide that based on regional tastes, some products don’t make sense to sell in the US or Canadian market. For this reason, a merchant would useCatalogto curate the product selection a customer sees when they log into their B2B store, based on their geographical location. Canadian customers will be able to see and purchase some products that US customers will not, and vice versa. WithCatalog, we can tailor the buying experience for each customer to ensure they only see the products and prices that are applicable to them.This new feature can integrate with your wholesale apps and workflows to offer unique wholesale product offerings and loyalty programs, with curated product selections to customize B2B buyer experiences at scale. It is available in an unstable API version now and we’re planning to make it available in the 2023-04 API version. Start experimenting today andlet us knowhow we can make it better.3. PriceLists APIYou can associate aPriceListwith aCatalogto determine the prices that are shown to customers ordering for a specific B2B company location.PriceListcan have a relative price adjustment or a fixed price per product variant.This allows app developers to create applications that can show different prices to different B2B buyers. For example, it is possible to usePriceListsto decrease the base price of the product by 5% andCatalogsto assign the discount to specific locations.4. Publications APIThe Publications API allows you to associate aPublicationwith aCatalogto determine which products are shown to B2B customers. If aPublicationisn't associated with aCatalog, then no products are available for the customer.Apps can create and manage aPublication, allowing developers to build integrations with external systems and automatically sync what products specific customers can purchase.The B2B primitives and their relationships.5. Order and DraftOrder APIsYou may be familiar withOrderandDraftOrderobjects. AnOrderis a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop, while aDraftOrderis anOrderthat a merchant initiates and sends an invoice to a customer to accept and pay.TheOrderandDraftOrderobjects have been updated to distinguish between DTC (direct-to-consumer) and B2B orders. AnOrdercan now return aPurchasingEntitythat represents the buyer (either a DTC customer or a B2B customer including a company and company location). Now, apps can pass in this crucial data if anOrderwas created in a B2B context.6. Payment Terms APIPayment terms enable you to set the length of time that a company has to pay for their order. You can set payment terms for any company location that you create. After payment terms are set for a location, any B2B customer for that location can enter payment information for the order. Apps can use this API to create solutions to automatically sync B2B custom payment terms from external systems. Now apps are able to query the associatedOrderandDraftOrderfrom thePaymentTermsobject.Building B2B apps for large merchantsThe addition of these APIs opens up opportunities for developers to reach and capture more Shopify Plus and Commerce Components by Shopify merchants by extending their current apps and solutions, or building new ones. In this section, we look at some example use cases.B2B apps for Shopify CheckoutB2B resources are not only exposed on the Shopify Admin API, but also on the Shopify Functions APIs.Shopify Functionsallow developers to customize the backend logic that powers parts of Shopify. Using the new B2B resources on theDeliveryandPayment Customization APIs, developers can build apps that filter, rename, reorder, and sort the delivery and payment options available to B2B customers. For example, you can build an app that uses Delivery Functions to modify the shipping options available for B2B customers, and aUI extensionto present an explanation of the change.The B2B primitives available with Shopify Functions.Loyalty apps for B2BApps for facilitating loyalty programs are popular for DTC merchants. Now, app developers can expand their user base by bringing this functionality to merchants offering B2B. Existing loyalty apps can use theCompanyandCompanyLocationresources and metafields to implement B2B loyalty programs. For example, you can build an app for tiering B2B buyers, and to associate unique perks such as no shipping fees for buyers with gold status.Webhooks for B2BNew webhook events were added for B2B resources. Subscribe to thePAYMENT_SCHEDULES_DUEtopic to get notified when a payment is due according to the payment terms of the order or draft order. Apps can use these webhooks to create unique workflows and integrations.Dig deeper into the developer products announced at Shopify EditionsJoin our upcoming Shopify Editions-focused AMA sessions on our Discord channel.

20,"Performance is at the heart of all of commerce. Think about the last time you bought anything: readiness and speed are critical across every interaction you face as a consumer. How fast is the checkout queue at the store, how fast can you get your package after you order it, and how quickly can you find the right item in the store? Thinking critically about how to extract every ounce of performance on behalf of our merchants is what keeps us up at night at Shopify.Since we’ve helped over 2 million businesses get online, we’ve worked hard to make sure that everyone’s sites stay as fast as possible. We want to make sure that no matter where someone is browsing from, on any device, they get a great experience that’s fast in every way. Why? Because speed means that businesses on Shopify can be more successful.We see this unfold in a real way everyday. To call out a real world example,Shopify’s team worked with Sunday Citizen, a fourth-generation luxury textile manufacturer to improve their site speed, with the goal of helping grow their business. After making several rendering improvements, Sunday Citizen was able to drive a 6% improvement in conversion and 4% decrease in site bounce rates. Users were also almost 4% more likely to add products to the cart, leading to more selling opportunities. All of this just from making their site load more quickly for visitors.Catch up on the latest developer announcements from the Shopify Winter ’23 EditionThe Shopify Winter ’23 Edition was full of big announcements for developers who work with Shopify. Visit our roundup on the Shopify Partner Blog to get caught up on all the news.Read articleTime to First BytePerformance has many dimensions and because everything affects it, and there’s no silver bullet to making a site fast. Everything from the type of JavaScript libraries you load to the types of media you include impacts the performance profile of your site. As a commerce platform, one of the key things we watch closely is Time to First Byte (TTFB).TTFB is important because it represents the baseline performance that someone experiences when visiting a shop. If TTFB is high, meaning that it takes longer for Shopify to start sending back content, your site will most definitely be slower. It’s also a piece of the performance puzzle that Shopify controls on the merchant's behalf, and it’s something we’ve spent years optimizing.As technology changes and the global patterns of commerce shift, we have to rethink our infrastructure and how we can get even better at reducing TTFB. Over the last year we’ve been working to evolve three dimensions of our infrastructure:Reducing network transit timeReducing the time the application takes to create a responseReducing the time databases take to retrieve dataWe’re looking at all of these dimensions but let’s zoom into the first. Information travels through the internet’s fiber at the speed of light. That sounds incredibly fast but when we’re looking at global distances, it’s not as fast as you would think. If someone from Germany visits a site that is hosted in North America, it takes over 100 ms just for that request to get to transit over the network to get to the servers that are meant to respond to that request. And of course, the response has to travel back to the visitor’s device and render into something real, which is another 100ms. Two hundred milliseconds is an amount of time that humans can notice, and Shopify works to fix anything that can make a site feel slow.To reduce network transit time in this world, we’re putting our application layer, what we call Storefront Renderer (SFR), in as many places as we can around the world. This is similar to something that Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) do called “edge caching,” but in our case we are moving not just the files that the browser retrieves but instead the whole system that renders storefronts. Commerce is personalized and dynamic, so we need to move the engine that powers commerce closer to the people who use it.Last year, we tripled SFR’s points of presence and for 20% of our traffic, we’ve reduced the TTFB by about 50%. . For example, instead of buyers in Germany needing to access an application hosted in the USA, we were now able to handle their request from within the EU — avoiding the need to cross an ocean and back to the user.Network transit time is just one lever we have to make all Shopify sites faster. Stay tuned for more on how we’re approaching the application and data layers of our infrastructure.Dig deeper into the developer products announced at Shopify EditionsJoin our upcoming Shopify Editions-focused AMA sessions on our Discord channel.

21,"The underlying technology that powers ecommerce stores is evolving at a dizzying pace, and brands need to respond in real time just to stay relevant against a backdrop of rising costs. It’s therefore more important than ever for developers to keep up-to-date on new trends and skills to be able to offer the best experience to merchants, so that they can, in turn, offer the best possible customer experience.We spoke to leading Shopify Partners and Developers to identify seven key development trends and emerging best practices you need to know to effectively build for Shopify in 2023. Consider them for your projects, and you’ll set up your clients—and yourself—for success.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success.

Improve themobile checkoutexperienceBlack Friday 2022 broke records, but for senior ecommerce consultantKurt Elsterthe real story was that on Thanksgiving eveninga record number of people shopped after dinner from their phones.“We've known for 10 years that ‘mobile is the future,’"" Elster points out, “and now we've hit the tipping point:Ecommerce orders are happening three out of four times on mobile.”Elster argues that ease of checkout is the last bottleneck to overcome for mobile conversion rates to exceed desktop conversion rates and highlights two new feature sets Shopify announced in 2022 that will change the checkout experience for the better.For Plus merchants,Shopify's Checkout UI Extensionsnow make checkout customizations as easy as installing an app.For non-Plus merchants,Shopify Functionswill provide backend scripting power similar to Plus plans' Script Editor. Functions will allow devs to make more efficient and powerful apps that streamline discount and checkout logic.“Both options will let Shopify Partner Developers package their solutions for sale in the Shopify App Store,” Elster explains. “It's a new blue ocean of monthly recurring revenue waiting to be made.”Gil Greenberg, founder ofCheckout Blocks, a Shopify Plus app that customizes checkout, agrees. To him, one of the biggest benefits of the new checkout UI extensions is that it incorporates the merchant's checkout styles seamlessly without any additional effort by the app developer.“Shopify provides a set of UI components that an app can leverage within checkout which can seem limiting at first but ultimately leads to faster development and a more consistent customer experience,” Greenberg says.In 2023, more merchants will be looking for apps that support the new checkout and it poses another opportunity for developers to create value for their clients.You might also like:9 Key Commerce Trends You Need to Watch in 2023.2. Cut down development time by enhancing pre-built themesDue to increased inflation and the threat of a recession, merchants are looking for more cost-saving measures in the new year. This means Shopify developers need to use their resources wisely.Anne Thomas, co-founder of Shopify appDesign Packs, believes that, with the rollout ofOnline Store 2.0, we are seeing more agencies leveraging add-on components to augment free or paid themes—such as Shopify’s ownDawntheme—rather than developing everything from scratch.“As a result, code updates can be handled by external theme developers instead of an internal team, and the technical debt associated with unmaintained custom builds can be reduced,” Thomas says.Together withShopify's GitHub integrationandShopify CLIfor themes, this approach simplifies code updates, Thomas explains, and allows easy integration of custom sections created by in-house developers alongside using libraries of pre-built sections.You might also like:Introducing Online Store 2.0: What it Means for Developers.3. Engage international audiences with lower costsAs rising interest rates cause retailers across industries to focus on improving unit economics, David Wagoner, co-founder and CMO of full-service ecommerce agencyP3 Media, expectsShopify MarketsandShopify Markets Proto become critical tools for brands testing cross-border expansion.“These tools solve most business process pain points around internationalization with low or no additional overhead,” Wagoner explains. “Up to this point, multinational brands have primarily opted to develop discrete online stores to serve each region in which they operate, or to go headless.”Wagoner points out that, while the discrete approach gives brands granular control over each instance, the cost of doing business under such a paradigm can be prohibitively high: Each store built this way requires its own product catalog, pricing, inventory, design, merchandising, payment options and tax compliance.The headless solution of coupling a frontend as a service solution to a single backend, meanwhile, solves content customization issues, but can be expensive to implement and leaves the merchant responsible for pricing, payment, tax, and payout issues.Markets Pro then offers the reverse: payments, taxation, and payouts are all handled automatically.Wagoner concludes: “With a significantly shorter time to value, no additional upfront cost to Shopify Plus users, the ability to stand up MVP shops in over 130 markets overnight, and the promise that Hydrogen will make Markets headless, these tools are positioned to be extremely viable alternatives for merchants who want to begin internationalizing with a low initial investment.”4. Make the most of metafieldsFor Ben Wellby, managing director of Shopify specialistsThought and Mortar, one feature stands out among the many recent Shopify development updates:Metafields.Metafields is a flexible way to extend Shopify’s native functionality by enabling the storage of additional information about a resource—like a size guide on a product page, a relevant warranty upsell within the basket, or some deeper customer information at signup.Metafields have benefits for customers, developers, and store owners alike; they improve everyone’s experience of the Shopify ecosystem.Ben Wellby, Managing Director, Thought and MortarThis “extra” information can be accessed on the front-end of the store, either by developers looking to expose this information through Liquid logic, or as a customer who may be in need of additional, supportive information.“Metafields used to be the stuff of developers, hidden from the store owner, but have now wholeheartedly been embraced by the Shopify community,” Wellby says. “Metafields have benefits for customers, developers, and store owners alike; they improve everyone’s experience of the Shopify ecosystem.”Specifically, the team at Thought and Mortar has identified the following trends:Developers relinquishing control to clients:Clients are now able to create their own metafields and link them into their own themes without the need for additional development resources.Customers looking for more content on PDP pages:More product-specific information empowers customers to make key decisions at key moments, thereby increasing engagement with content such as size guides, warranty info, and product weights with or without packaging. As a result, customers need less customer service.Store owners storing more data-points against customer records:Metafields can be used for both connecting APIs with third-party CRMs, as well as giving customer service teams immediate access to customer information at any touchpoint across the Shopify admin (e.g. VAT numbers, preferred contact methods, customer IDs).The focus on metafields themselves:Metafields continue to evolve and already enable developers to create stores that are native to Shopify, resulting in safer and more sturdy ecommerce experiences.You might also like:How to work with Metafields when building Shopify themes.5. Take headless commerce to the next levelAs the understanding of headless commerce matures, Ian Jamieson, head of technology at Shopify Plus agencySwanky, believes we will see the increased adoption ofHydrogen(Shopify’s React-based framework for building custom storefronts) andOxygen(Shopify’s hosting platform for Hydrogen storefronts).Jamieson expects more complete new headless builds, the integration of standaloneHydrogen UI componentswithin existing headless projects, and more advanced and innovative use cases beyond enhanced performance and improved developer experience.Specifically, he sees these opportunities presented by composable architectures:A shift tounified content platformssuch asSanity.io, which enables the creation of truly dynamic and regionalized content experiences while reducing the workload on content creation teams.Deep integration ofblazing-fastpersonalization and machine learning recommendation engines, such as those provided byCrossing MindsandDynamic Yield, to provide a more engaging buying experience and increase retention.Use ofbetter A/B testing and feature-flagging capabilities, via platforms suchLaunchDarklyandGrowthbook, which derive and share valuable insights into buying behavior.Drew Garratt, principal headless developer at Shopify Plus agencyWe Make Websites, thinks Shopify’srecent acquisitionof open-source React frameworkRemixwill push headless commerce even further.“Remix has been praised for the efficiency and flexibility of its routing system and use of server components,” Garratt explains. “Hydrogen on Remix will now unleash the potential of developers to create even more flexible, complex, and varied experiences—at no additional cost.”6. Adopt an objectives-first mentalityGalen King, founder and strategic director of Shopify Plus agencyLucid, points out that if you’ve worked with a client for some time, you will have a constantly growing list of feature requests and requirements for changes to their store. It’s less likely to have a clear picture of their goals and objectives.“Unless you have significant experience, discipline, and expertise to lead clients with firmness and confidence, it’s easy to fall into a cycle of the client prescribing the solutions,” King cautions. “You will find yourself simply building what they ask—and usually without a sufficient budget, timeline, or scope of work to thoroughly explore the problems they are facing.”The issue with building features and functionality, however, is that it’s easy to lose the view of where your client is, where they want to be, and how you might help them get there.“If, on the other hand, you can reframe the list of features and functionality requests to focus on the overarching goals and objectives, you will find that it becomes much easier to determine what is important and what is going to have a genuine chance of moving the brand forward,” King suggests.This helps you lead your clients better as you will ask better questions, unpack thewhyand the purpose behind requests, and, ultimately, develop better solutions to the underlying problems.By reframing the requests, you’ll also find that many client requests aren’t actually necessary and you and/or your team will spend less time building things that have little impact and more time designing simpler solutions to increasingly complex problems that will have real value to your clients.As a result, you will be able to iterate more quickly, keep your clients for longer, and increase profitability for your team and for your clients. You will find that you quickly become less of a tool in their toolbox and more of a highly-valued expert resource that is instrumental in their growth.You might also like:Five Steps to Successful Client Management.7.

22,"Change is the only constant in commerce, and business owners need to be able to adapt at a moment’s notice. But commerce trends do emerge—you just need to know what to look for in order to build the right apps, themes, and products to best support your clients and customers.Commerce itself is facing bigger challenges over the coming months than ever before. Global businesses are still recovering from the negative impact of the pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to sanctions that delayed or paused trade altogether, and economic instability is driving thehighest inflation in 40 years. Aglobal recession now seems inevitable.Total retail sales are still climbing but the growth is slowing. And to be successful, brands need to become even more resilient when facing the unexpected. Consumers, meanwhile, have less money to spend in 2023 and at the same time are more conscious of the environment and ethical business practices. Plus, they’re now used to being able to purchase a product instantly, wherever they’re shopping.So, how do you meet these challenges, support merchants, and drive your own business growth in the new year?We asked leading Shopify Partners for their insights on the most important commerce trends in 2023. Take their advice to heart and you’ll be equipped to build even better, and support your clients to adapt in an ever-changing commerce landscape.For a deeper dive into the global developments that will shape this coming year, check out Shopify’sCommerce Trends 2023report.1. Embrace flexible commerceIf the past few years in online commerce have taught us anything, it’s that merchants need to be able to quickly respond to change in order to thrive. This need for adaptability is encapsulated by the idea ofFlexible Commerce, which argues that merchants need tools that can be tailored to their brand, customer base, and operational needs at a pace measured in weeks rather than months.Gavin Ballard, founder and CEO of Shopify Plus PartnerDisco Labsand Shopify appSubmarine, is a leading advocate of the Flexible Commerce movement and believes merchants can set themselves up for success in 2023 by embracing the following basic Flexible Commerce principles:Invest in “best-in-class” instead of “all-in-one”“The days of the ‘Swiss army knife’ solution are coming to a close—merchants today need the right tool for each of a dozen key areas of the modern commerce stack,” Ballard explains.He suggests that merchants should become comfortable with researching and investing in specialized solutions, rather than looking to tools that try to cover too many bases.“Something that covers 80 percent of your needs across three or four areas sounds great, but that 20 percent will be where you start losing margin and market share,” Ballard argues.“One of the great things about platforms with a vibrant ecosystem like Shopify is that you have a solid, stable foundation from which you can plug in a variety of best-in-class apps in every niche,” he adds.One of the great things about platforms with a vibrant ecosystem like Shopify is that you have a solid, stable foundation from which you can plug in a variety of best-in-class apps in every niche.Gavin Ballard, founder and CEO of Disco LabsOne way larger merchants customize their tech stack without adding complexity on the back end is to choose their right apps for their business from the dozens ofShopify Plus Certified App Partners.Build a culture of iterate-and-testDespite the pandemic showing that being able to rapidly adapt and innovate is crucial for commerce success, Ballard’s experience is that too many merchants—especially larger ones—are still moving too slowly to capitalize on change.“If spinning up a separate Shopify instance to test a new product or new market is a months-long endeavor with multiple layers of approval and planning, it’s time to reevaluate how you get things done internally,” he says.Ballard suggests that ecommerce managers and their teams spend time in 2023 reviewing their internal culture and processes with an eye to encouraging rapid delivery, iteration, and testing.Default to globalWhile multi-region, multi-currency, multi-lingual commerce has never been “easy” per se, it’s never been better supported by platforms such as Shopify and their ecosystems as now.“If you’re starting out with a new store or initiative in 2023, I’d strongly recommend laying the groundwork for your international strategy from day one,” Ballard says. “You can do this by selecting platforms and tools that have multi-currency, multi-locale support baked in.”When combined with a culture of rapid iteration and testing, having a “global by default” mentality can mean testing out new regions for your brand, app, theme, or product takes a matter of mere days.You might also like:5 Practical Ways to Help Your Clients Deal With Supply Chain Issues.2. Focus on sustainability with “recommerce”Nathan Abbott, head of growth at full-service Shopify Plus agencyUnderwaterpistol, believes that in 2023 we’ll see the continued expansion of the “recommerce” trend—the selling of previously owned goods.“The market for pre-owned and resold goods is incredibly exciting,” Abbott says. “It showcases the continued—and growing—importance of sustainability in the ecommerce space, which in turn encourages brands to engage with more environmentally sound practices.”Recommerce showcases the continued—and growing—importance of sustainability in the ecommerce space, which in turn encourages brands to engage with more environmentally sound practices.Nathan Abbott, Head of Growth at UnderwaterpistolRecommerce also offers a more cost-effective solution to consumers than buying brand-new products, Abbott points out. Given the challenging economic climate, this is going to be more important than ever.To engage with the thriving resale market, Abbott suggests brands take a critical look at how their products can interact with sustainability. And if their products don't have the ability to be resold, brands should look at how they can embrace a more sustainable approach in other areas, such as within their returns setup or the packaging they use.“As consumers become more environmentally conscious, sustainability is becoming a more important factor that impacts where people buy from, particularly amongst the younger generations withnearly three in four Gen Z consumershappy to pay an extra 10 percent for a product if they know it’s sustainable,” Abbott says.You might also like:Building a Shopify App That Makes a Positive Difference in the World (And Makes a Profit).3. Differentiate your in-store experienceAs lockdown restrictions eased after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers started to return to physical stores. For Dan Conboy, director of ecommerce strategy atIDHL Group, it’s clear that customers continue to want experience-led brick and mortar stores.Conboy points to the success of fitness apparel and accessories brandGymshark, which recently opened its first-ever permanent brick-and-mortar store on London’s famous Regent Street.“It could have just been a store,” Conboy explains, “but the Gymshark team recognized the opportunity to use the space to create a greater connection with their fans. So it also features workout spaces and even a juice bar. The whole retail floor has been designed to—at the click of a button—transform into a gym space.”From a tech point of view, the whole store is powered by Shopify POS, enabling Gymshark to create that single customer view and really understand how their customers are shopping across all their different sales channels.The reaction to the store from fans and the retail community alike has been overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the importance of creating purposeful spaces that elevate the brand and—ultimately—create great buying experiences.Ben Francis, CEO of Gymshark, explains that for Gymshark its first physical retail store is all about the experience.4. Invest in customer loyaltyPaid acquisition costsskyrocketedin 2022. This, combined with less ability to track paid advertising’s impact on sales in a now cookie-less, privacy-centric world, means that customer retention is now more important than ever, according toKate Collinson, an ecommerce consultant and growth marketer specializing in Shopify and Shopify Plus.“First, it’s important to know your customer retentionmetrics,” Collinson says. She recommends knowing your:Repeat purchase rate over one yearAverage duration between purchaseCustomer lifetime value over three years“All this data is at your fingertips in Shopify analytics and using some simple calculations,” she says. “Return to these metrics every quarter.”Collinson says that successful stores are investing in their first-party data and owned channels like email and SMS by focusing on lead-generation opportunities across every point of the upper funnel.Brands need to be mindful of this valuable relationship by developing more sophisticated segmentation strategies based on engagement and behavior, and giving the customer more choice around communication frequency.“The consumers’ buying cycle is multi-touch, so bridging the experience between onsite and offsite is critical,” adds Sharon Goldstein, VP Revenue atPantastic, owner ofLimeSpot.The consumers’ buying cycle is multi-touch, so bridging the experience between onsite and offsite is critical.Sharon Goldstein, VP Revenue at Pantastic“It takes up to eight to 10 touch points to close a purchase, and including personalization in email and SMS experiences through targeted recommendations provides consumers with a seamless journey to get them over the finish line,” Goldstein says. “If the buying experience isn’t consistent across that journey, there will be breakage.”The biggest mistake Collinson sees brands make is delaying customer loyalty strategies because they think it requires a fully fledged, customized loyalty program.“That’s often a big investment and may not necessarily ‘fit’ the brand,” she explains. “But there’s nothing stopping you from sending campaigns to VIP segments or developing automations to build loyalty in an ad-hoc way using your existing tools likeKlaviyoandShopify Flow.”Collinson suggests offering previews of launches and sales or creating little surprise-and-delight moments such as exclusive gifts with purchase, additional discounts or invitations.“Every repeat purchase increases the likelihood of another and lowers your overall cost of acquisition,” she advises.You might also like:4 Key Ways to Differentiate Your Clients’ Ecommerce Stores From the Competition.5. Maximize customer lifetime valueNick Disabato, founder ofDraft.nu, a design consultancy for Shopify Plus stores, agrees that it’s all about the customer in 2023.“Ecommerce isn’t a video game where you stare at your ad dashboards and try to make the numbers go up,” he says. “It’s relationship management with real people, at scale. Store design in 2022 has taught me one thing: Recognize the essential humanity of your work, and you’ll profit.”Ecommerce isn’t a video game where you stare at your ad dashboards and try to make the numbers go up,” he says. “It’s relationship management with real people, at scale.Nick Disabato, founder of Draft.nuDisabato says that customers don’t talk about awesome brands or awesome products. They talk about howtheybecame awesomebecauseof your product or brand.Merchants therefore need to figure out how they can help their customers succeed, and if they do so in a way that makes the brand uniquely different from others—beyond rolling out a loyalty program or turning on subscriptions.Disabato recommends the following process:Talkdirectly to customers to understand where their pain points are, and what drove them to buy from you. Store owners might not know these things out of the gate, despite what they may think.Write. Provide a positioning statement (who you are, what you do, what makes you special) on your home page. Address objections on product detail pages. And most importantly, put together an email sequence for new customers that helps them get the most out of your products.Follow through. Measure the impact of your changes, and adapt them over time. Keep following up with customers to identify and address ongoing pain points.

Customers simply won’t have as much money to spend on products as in previous years.Therefore, Freyja Wedderkop, marketing executive at Shopify Plus agencyWe Make Websites, believes the products customersarepurchasing have to serve a purpose, and the brands they’re purchasing from should align with their values.“We’ll see brands own what sets them apart from the competition, including developing products that sell well, meeting their customers' needs, solving problems, and carrying their company value,” Wedderkop predicts. “Ecommerce businesses need to hone in on and communicate this with customers effectively through their ecommerce store, email marketing, and user journey in order to succeed in 2023.”Wedderkop points to We Make Websites clientGood Americanwhose brand identity is creating good pairs of jeans that fit women of all sizes.“Of course, they sell other products, but they’re aware they’re known for their inclusive approach to selling jeans,” she explains. “And so their marketing, communication with customers, and ecommerce site all reflect this.”Good American’s jeans product page shows their jeans on several different-sized models to reflect their size inclusivity and goal to create good jeans that fit every body type.7. Automate and outsource to reduce costsFor Ross Beyeler, the chief operating officer atTrellis Commerce, financial challenges meanecommerce companiesshould specifically have two things in mind when it comes to optimizing profit: automation and outsourcing.Beyeler recommends considering the following tools:According toLexisNexis Risk Solutions, American ecommerce merchants see $3.60 for every $1 of fraud. Platforms likeSignifydnot only help to reduce fraud overall but specifically help to reduce chargebacks, an often “hidden” cost to merchants.Over85 percent of Shopify merchants use third-party apps, which means getting useful and consistent data across these platforms can be challenging. Tools likeCeligohelp to streamline integrating third-party apps while reducing the need for increased labor costs in maintaining your data and systems.With at least75 percent of retailers offering some sort of free shipping, optimizing your shipping costs is key. Tools likePretty Damn Quickoffer automated delivery method recommendations that not only create a better experience for the customer but also reduce costs to the merchant by selecting the best possible shipping method.You might also like:How and Why to Integrate No-Code Automation into Your Shopify App.8. Put more emphasis on social commerceAs search engine results pages become increasingly dominated by sponsored placements, customers are starting their purchasing journeys in other places—such as social media. In fact, a recent Statista survey showed that over60 percent of shoppers between 18 and 34made a purchase as a result of branded social posts.Jason Stokes, founder and CEO of premier Shopify agencyEastside Co, also points out that not only doessocial commercemake it easier to buy, it lets customers interact with brands directly, via user generated content (UGC).“It helps reinforce the merchant-customer relationship,” Stokes explains. “As an added bonus, UGC also doubles up as free, authentic marketing content for the business.”User-generated content helps reinforce the merchant-customer relationship. As an added bonus, UGC also doubles up as free, authentic marketing content for the business.Jason Stokes, founder and CEO of Eastside CoOn top of that, social media gives you access to customer data.“Make sure you capitalize on this, and target your social ads to reach people who are likely to be actively interested in your products or services,” Stokes recommends. “Try getting started with just a few of your products—bestselling or low-cost ones to begin with.”Lowering the barrier to entry will improve the conversion rate and generate more sales quickly, Stokes says.Eastside Co ran ads for San Francisco Wine School to a mixed remarketing audience, based on their prior Facebook, Instagram, and website interactions.

Bring products to life through augmented realityDeb Mecca, director of marketing at Shopify appIn Cart Upsell, believes that augmented reality (AR) will be an increasingly leveraged technology in commerce in 2023. We’re now on the cusp of a new era of digital connection, and AR—as a way to personalize products and enhance the shopping experience—is becoming a viable option as more consumers around the world adopt the technology.“The main benefits are a reduction in returns and a higher level of trust when purchasing items that would typically require a more intimate view,” Mecca explains. “This is especially true for home furnishing products that can fit into a space, or beauty products that require color matching.”Beauty products in particular cannot be resold due to health and safety issues, which means that every return is lost revenue and impacts the carbon footprint.Mecca points out that establishing AR technology on Shopify stores has been made easy by a handful of Shopify apps, such asAR & 3D Product Viewer,Angle 3D Configurator, andZakeke Visual Customizer.Stores can showcase 360-degree views of products on the product pages for one level of personalization. These apps also make it easy for products to appear on faces, heads, feet, wrists, or living spaces.Shopify merchant Forno Piombo uses AR & 3D Product Viewer to imagine its pizza oven on a balcony (left), CB2.com lets shoppers place a couch in a living room space (middle), and Dior enables customers to choose a lipstick color and then to try it out on their own lips (right).Prepare for the unexpectedTo be successful in 2023, it’s crucial to be ready for uncertainty. There has been a marked shift from theecommerce trends that defined 2022. Flexibility and agility across every aspect of the business will become competitive differentiators.And as consumer behavior is also changing rapidly and expectations of brands evolve, improving the customer experience—online and offline at every touchpoint of the entire customer journey—also needs to be a top priority for the new year.Many strategies will revolve around cost-cutting and boosting cash flow, which means automation and outsourcing will play a bigger role over the coming months as well.

23,"Low-code and no-code technologies are on the rise.Gartnerprojects that the market for low-code technologies will grow 20 percent this year to hit $27 billion. And low-code application platforms are the main driver of this growth. With new no-code and low-code tools entering the Shopify market too, you’re now presented with an excellent opportunity to implement this approach in your everyday business.In this article, we’ll cover the difference between low-code and no-code technologies and how you can use them to streamline your work with clients and introduce new low- and no-code-powered services to your current offerings.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success. Join for free and access educational resources, developer preview environments, and recurring revenue share opportunities.Sign upWhat is low-code and no-code, and why are they gaining popularity?Low-code and no-code are ways of developing apps and integrations with a minimal amount of development work or, in the case of no-code, no custom code work at all. They’re primarily used for three major reasons: speed, efficiency, and low cost. They allow for faster deployment of public and custom Shopify apps, meaning teams can focus on more important, complex tasks.To illustrate the real-world applications of these solutions,a recent survey reportedthat most respondents use low-code and no-code tools to create new applications and automate workflows, data collection, and reporting. The benefits, according to those respondents, were improved productivity, reduced app development time, and being able to automate manual processes.This goes a long way to explaining why these tools are gaining popularity with agencies, developers, and freelancers alike. It provides businesses with a lean approach to app development that offers greater flexibility of resource allocation. You have likely used many of these tools in the past without even realizing they are categorized as low-code or no-code.Our team at The Taproom, for example, regularly usesZapierto automate certain tasks: connecting form data to Google Sheets, signing leads up to our mailing list, and sending a message to our group Slack channel when a new lead completes our new project application.We’re alsoShopify Flowpower users; we always look for opportunities to quickly automate a task for a merchant, such as tagging a customer as VIP after placing a large order, to save our team development time and make it easy for our clients to implement changes in the future.Depending on whether you use low-code or no-code, you have a much wider pool of talent on your team from which you can assign tasks related to developing a new tool. People on your marketing team with no experience in coding can get involved with no-code apps, freeing up time for developers to work on tasks that really need their attention and expertise. For example, our data specialist can handle the entire data migration process without having to write a line of code by usingMatrixify, a no-code tool for data import and export.Let’s take a deeper look at both low-code and no-code to understand where they fit in and how you might be able to use them in your own processes.Low-codeLow-code is a way of creating new apps that allows developers of any skill level to quickly design them with a minimal amount of hand-coding. It offers what’s essentially a shortcut, taking a drag-and-drop approach by allowing developers to use blocks of existing code and plugging them into a workflow.This approach means that developers can reduce the amount of time they spend hand-coding the same elements from other similar builds, and focus instead on the custom elements that make that app unique. The more skilled the developer, the faster they’ll be able to work and the more they’ll be able to do with this low-code approach.Developers can reduce the amount of time they spend hand-coding the same elements from other similar builds, and focus instead on the custom elements that make that app unique.Who low-code is useful forThis is a particularly useful tool for teams that want to develop and deploy certain types of apps and tools quickly, that use a lot of similar base code to other apps they’ve previously developed, or that base code already exists within the low-code tool. Most commonly, low-code is used for integrations, automations, customer service, ecommerce, data analysis, and web apps.When to use low-codeLow-code solutions are best-suited for freelancers and teams who are looking to create efficiencies in their workflows while also having some level of control over the code.Low-code solutions are best-suited for freelancers and teams who are looking to create efficiencies in their workflows while also having some level of control over the code.Mechanicis an excellent example of a Shopify app that serves this purpose. This development and automation platform essentially replaces a significant amount of custom app development you may do on your own, while being able to customize the workflows and write your own Liquid code to meet a client’s specific needs. Mechanic starts at $9/month and scales based on the merchant’s Shopify plan.Similar to creating a collection within Shopify or using Shopify Flow, Mechanic allows you to create tasks without writing a line of code.If you want to get more granular with your workflow, you can write your own script using Liquid.No-CodeAs the name might suggest, no-code doesn’t require any hand-coding during creation and deployment. It’s also typically a drag-and-drop approach, but designed for those who are unfamiliar with coding and programming languages who still want to develop a specific solution.Everything the user needs will typically be included within the building tool. A good example is Shopify’s store builder, which enables merchants to feasibly design and build a basic storefront with no coding experience.In short, no-code makes it much easier to assign non-developer team members to tasks to produce the desired result.Who no-code is useful forAs mentioned above, this is going to be most useful for those on your team who don’t have any coding experience. The drag-and-drop approach to building apps, integrations, and automations means that anyone with some basic training and knowledge can use these platforms and build on them.No-code is also useful for merchants. By implementing no-code automation tools into their store, they can automate a large number of tasks for which they may previously have needed custom development.When to use no-codeIf you need a fairly simple front end solution, and you need it quickly, no-code is a good option.A best practice for no-code is to consider it within the wider framework of a project or internal infrastructure to ensure that anyone working with no-code and no knowledge of development isn’t going to interfere with systems and processes already in place. Read through a no-code solution’s documentation to make sure the solution will meet your needs. Spend some time scoping out a full solution using the toolbeforeyou begin the work, so you have a plan of action in place and don’t have to start from scratch if the tool ends up not working for you.As mentioned above,Zapieris a good example of a no-code solution. It enables users to take advantage of webhooks to connect different apps and design automations without having to actually hand-code the connections themselves.Another excellent example isAlloy. Built with similar underlying technologies as Zapier, Alloy makes it easy for Shopify merchants to set up for their store automatically. Alloy provides large merchants with varying levels of workflow, and runs dependent on merchant needs. Engineers can use Alloy’s SDK to build custom connections to invoke workflows directly from your code while keeping the connections clean and understandable for non-technical users.Alloy’s drag-and-drop workflow editor is easy to use for non-technical users, while also providing an SDK for engineers to invoke workflows where needed.How to use low- and no-code tools to enhance your work with clientsBefore we dive into how to use low- and no-code tools within your own team, let’s clear up a couple of potential misconceptions.First, these solutions are not meant to reduce the importance of developers and data scientists. In fact, the reality is quite the opposite. Low-code and no-code solutions take care of all the time-consuming, basic work, allowing for a much more efficient use of time for those key members on your team.Second, these solutions don’t take anything away from client projects; you aren’t delivering a lesser product just because you’re leveraging this approach. Low-code and no-code solutions greatly improve efficiency and speed up the process of developing a number of apps and integrations for clients, meaning their projects are completed faster and to a high standard. Your team is instead focusing on those parts of a client project that require greater finesse and customization.Now, let’s get onto how you can take advantage of low-code and no-code tools within your organization.Theme customizationsTools such asBuilder.ioandShogunare an excellent way to facilitate the theme development process for clients. Instead of building custom landing pages for merchants, you can instead focus on building out landing pages and custom components in a drag-and-drop user interface, saving both your client’s money and your team’s time, so you can concentrate on more complex projects.Public and custom app developmentWhether you’re building a middleware service to connect two apps or building a more custom experience, tools such asMechanicandAlloy Embeddedcan significantly speed up your development time. These tools allow you to take a serverless approach with a predetermined user interface, giving you the opportunity to focus on the actual integration instead of the busy work of building out an app’s scaffolding and server configuration. If you choose a third-party no- or low-code solution for building a public app, make sure any dependencies you introduce into your development process will continue to be supported well into the future.Building your own no-code or low-code appAs evidenced by the tools mentioned above, no-code and low-code solutions are saving merchants hours per day by using automated workflows for operational tasks. Agencies and freelancers love using these tools to cut down on development time for projects, which in turn increases profit margins on client work.In November 2020,FollowAnalytics reportedthat 74 percent of the top 50 retail apps are now a hybrid mix of low- and no-code and traditional native development. With this in mind, you’re in good company if you choose to take a hybrid approach to Shopify app development. Not only will it speed up the time your team spends building, but incorporating the no-code paradigm into your app can in turn save your future customers time and money by using your app.Low-code and no-code tools are your friends, not enemiesInitially, it may seem like the existence of low-code and no-code tooling only takes work away from your client workload. However, these tools should be seen as extensions of your capabilities rather than being in competition with them.If you’ve never built a Shopify app, for example, the process could be daunting—especially if you’re primarily focused on front end development. But by leveraging the tools that already exist, you can begin exploring a new service offering of building out interactivity with two services via a middleware app developed on top of a tool such as Mechanic without ever having to know how to configure your own server.Remember: Low-code and no-code tools are opportunities, not threats. Add them to your arsenal and embrace the new capabilities they bring to your workflow."

26,"Shopify’s mission is only possible with best-in-class commerce apps that let merchants customize Shopify for every kind of business.That’s why we’re laser focused on providing the tools that developers need to build better apps and succeed in the Shopify ecosystem.AtJune Editionswe launched a host of new features to help create world class app experiences. Developers can now take advantage of full-screen mode to create immersive experiences in the admin. You can also integrate your app’s own navigation as a subnav within Shopify. Plus, apps now load 2x faster on mobile devices when youturn on App Bridge mobile enhancements.Now, we’re improving load time and introducing new performance standards that make it easier for merchants to access the apps they need. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's changing.Updated OAuth recommendationsFirst impressions are critical and we need your help to improve a key part of the app experience: the initial load. Until now, our recommended OAuth flow added unnecessary time to the app load and created significant visual disruption. Today, we’ve updated our recommendations to make the initial app load faster, cleaner, and more enjoyable for merchants.For apps created with Shopify templates before August 23, 2022, you need to update your OAuthfollowing these migration instructions.For new apps, you will automatically meet ourperformance guidelinesby building with the latestapp templatesor simply followingGetting started with OAuth.Our performance improvementsWe're also updating all we can to improve performance without developer action. This starts with pre-loading. Shopify will automatically preload frequently used embedded apps, significantly improving load time. You may see extra traffic to your app as a result of this change.Shopify will also improve the app loading user experience, giving merchants a faster and less painful experience. We’re doing the heavy lifting here, so no need to worry about these details unless you’re curious. We will pre-load the app header (app name and icon) before merchants open an app so it's available instantly and add a new loading indicator so it does not appear that the page is unresponsive before the app has loaded.Looking aheadAs the saying goes, “you can't improve what you don't measure.” That’s why, later this fall, we will introduce new App Bridge APIs that will make it easier for you to measure your apps’Core Web Vitals.Web vitals in the embedded app loading processThis performance data is important because, following the release of these APIs, we will also release guidelines forLargest Contentful Paint,First Input Delay, andCumulative Layout Shiftperformance.Apps that meet these guidelines - in addition to having implemented our updated OAuth recommendations and enabledoptimized loading on mobile devices- will be eligible to be featured on our highest-converting surfaces. Your apps get more visibility, and business owners get access to the best commerce apps available."
27,"Shopify's monthly update roundup provides you with summaries of the most important product updates you need to keep your work flowing smoothly.Read on for this month's information.Unpublished apps will be removed soonCompliance cutoff dates are quickly approaching to get your app listed in the Shopify App Store in accordance with our newPartner Program Agreement. Be sure to submit your app as soon as possible to avoid reviewal delays-it usually takes our partners several weeks to complete the review process. Please check your dashboard notifications and email to find your cutoff date.Submitting your appUpdates required for embedded apps and themesSpeed is at the forefront of everything we do. With that in mind, we have consolidated Shopify’s admin domains under a single domain: admin.shopify.com. This change reduces page reloads when you navigate the Shopify admin. You will notice this new domain and unique store extension in place of the usual myshopify.com URL. This will only change the URL that a merchant uses to access their store admin-it will not have any impact on the URLs in the APIs.For embedded apps to work correctly on the new admin domain, ensure:Thecontent security policyincludes admin.shopify.com.The app is onApp Bridge 2.0 or higher. We recommend upgrading toApp Bridge 3.0.The app has correctly implemented thehost parameter.For the theme editor to work correctly within the new admin domain, ensure that your themes do not reach outside the frame (for example: referencing window.top). Instead, followthis documentationto be able to detect the theme editor.Local delivery and pickup for subscriptions: API updateShopify is introducing Local Delivery and Pickup as new delivery methods for merchants to sell Subscriptions.Partners will be able to use the Admin GraphQL API to retrieve, create and edit subscriptions contracts with Shipping, Local Delivery or Pickup as delivery methods.Important to note:SubscriptionContract.deliveryMethodwill return null for clients using API versions earlier than 2022-10 when the contract is created with Local Delivery or Pickup. If you have been inferring a subscription has only digital products because the delivery method is null, please adopt our new GraphQL changes.We also recommend taking a look at general delivery terms your app might be using, such as “delivers” or “ships”. Consider replacing them with broader terminology like “fulfills” or “recurs” that cover all modes of delivery.If your app provides subscription capabilities, please look out for this change coming this month.

28,"This is part two of our Made with Metafields series, and you can catch up onthe first part in this article.Metafields are about sharing the right content with the right audience in the right context. They offer a simple, flexible way to build a personalized storefront and deliver experiences that delight new and returning customers—and keep them coming back for more.You can also help your clients use Metafields to organize your back office operations by centralizing data like customer details, shipping information, and inter-departmental notes. The best part? You can deliver all of these benefits without writing any code. With just a few clicks, you can create and reuse customized data-collection fields, and add them to your admin or to your online store, without touching a line of code.Metafields were first introduced to Shopify as a place to store data within Shopify - a system that would work across Shopify and that could be used to tell Shopify certain things. Previously they were only available as an API facing feature and storefront customization was only possible through liquid code.Now you can store all of your store’s unique data —whether it’s related to customer birthdays, care instructions, material lists, or the packaging requirements for orders— and all of this has the potential to become actionable insights for anyecommercebusiness.Today we’re here to talk about Seavees. Founded in 1964, SeaVees was launched as the original California sneaker brand, pioneering the evolution of gym shoes into casual footwear. SeaVees flourished in the 1960s only to languish, forgotten, until the brand was rediscovered in a Tokyo thrift store in the mid-2000s. Since SeaVees’ relaunch in Santa Barbara, California, the brand has become known for their comfy yet style-forward shoes designed for everyday wear and special occasions alike.SeaVeesThe SeaVees team had a plethora of options for building a compelling online storefront. “The biggest piece of running an effectiveecommerceoperation, in my view, is the ability to take a request from somebody and turn that into an action that is repeatable [and] scalable,” Pete Hardie, former e-commerce manager at SeaVees and co founder of e-commerce agencyBonshore, emphasizes.Metafields empowered SeaVees to provide personalized experiences that collect actionable data. The ease of use and time savings were big wins for the shoe company. Among the advantages:Metafields have allowed SeaVees to create a slew of custom product display options that can be kept up to date without development work.One-off issues and requests can be supported with scalable solutions that allow the team to deliver an improved shopping experience.Metafields have reduced the time and money required by SeaVees for web development by at least 10 hours per week.Leveraging the efficiency gained by no longer needing to maintain endless groups of tags, the SeaVees team was able to pivot to focus on other mission-critical storefront features.We built almost all new features using Metafields in some way or another. I don’t know if we could have done it without them.Pete Hardie, former e-commerce manager at SeaVees and co founder of e-commerce agency BonshoreLike La Boutique MOSO, most of the SeaVees Metafields require no coding. By creating new metafields for different custom product content, the SeaVees content team was able to pull relevant product-specific information onto the product pages—featuring facets such as size information, the origin of a particular style, or a guide to the materials used. All of this can be done through Shopify’s admin interface.As powerful as Metafields are on their own, they are even more powerful with a little development, Pete says. “For me, it’s the ability to use Metafields in the theme file logic that makes them special, allowing us to essentially build tools for non-developers to solve almost any need.”One of the issues SeaVees faced was working out how to approach sold-out products that weren’t due back in stock for over 6 months. Pete viewed this as a problem, wondering, “Is this helpful for SeaVees’ customers that they see that this shoe exists, but it is not coming back in stock for eight months? Or actually, is there a period when we want to just hide it from the site for the time being, right?”The solution was to create a “hide_product” metafield that can be set to be True or False. Once the metafield was created, SeaVees added logic to the theme files that checked the “hide_product” metafield before displaying the product on a collection page. As a result, the merchandising team can now choose to hide products as needed through Shopify’s admin interface.This way, the product page always stays active, preventing errors when customers hit dead-end links. As Pete notes, “Building out the ‘hide_product’ field not only solves the initial issue, but created a repeatable and scalable tool for ongoing site merchandising. There are so many examples like that where we’ve added functionality using metafields.”“Once we understood how Metafields can be built and then how they can be pulled into the theme files, it opened up a new world for us of stuff that we could do,” says Pete. “Not only did Metafields save the SeaVees team hours of work maintaining and keeping track of product tags, it also has allowed them to add significant improvements to the shopping experience like advanced collection filters, improved product swatches and customized helpful product-specific content such as sizing advice.”Moving forward, SeaVees is excited about future plans for marketing their shoes through deeper storytelling, and has a list of use cases they may adopt with the help of Metafields. “Now we have more time to focus on building out more creative experiences,“ Pete shares.Metafields offers a powerful yet flexible way to enhance your storefront, drive conversions and increase SEO. And anyone from shop owners to developers can use it. Get started by adding metafields through the Shopify admin section, and applying them throughout your store via your theme editor.To learn more about how your storefront can make the most of Metafields, visit ourMetafields Help Center.

A lean and nimble company, La Boutique MOSO is led by co-founder Jean-Baptiste Lainé, who also oversees the store’s online development efforts.La Boutique MOSO uses Metafields to provide additional context for products.“With Metafields, we can have much better content on our online store, and we can scale our store much more easily because everything is structured in a way that allows us to add products and brands a lot faster, with the same consistency, and the same level of quality across the entire catalog,” Jean-Baptiste shares. “So for us, Shopify is becoming not only one of the bestecommerceplatforms, but it's also becoming a full-featured content management system.”Shopify’s Metafields also extend the search and discovery aspects of the store. By adding Metafields to products, and creating new filters in the Shopify admin, it opened a world of filtering options for shoppers. The Metafields act as a type of tag system, classifying product types into easily sortable categories using the storefront’s search feature.“If you go to any collection with a lot of products, you can use Metafields now to filter the products,” Jean-Baptiste explains. “For example, you can filter the products based on your type of skin, you can filter the products based on your skin problem. You can filter the products based on their certification, whether they're made in France or not, whether they're certified organic or not, and even whether the packaging is sustainable or not.”Metafield ListsUse Metafield lists to show multiple pieces of content in one metafield, for example a list of ingredients. You can also use lists for more powerful storefront filtering–all through the admin without any coding. Learn more at theShopify Help Center.As an added benefit, Metafields helped improve La Boutique MOSO’s SEO search results and conversion rates. Jean-Baptiste discovered that Google’s search engine crawls content stored in Shopify’s Metafields and shows results based on Metafields criteria.La Boutique MOSO also turned to Metafields after experiencing slow page-load issues with its initial loyalty program, built through a third-party application. The original application was bloated with unnecessary features, causing extreme lag times for product page loading and negatively impacting the online shopping experience. Jean-Baptiste and his team needed a different way to build La Boutique MOSO’s loyalty program that improved the site speed while offering a personalized experience that fosters long-lasting customer relationships.The solution to their challenge was simple: Why not build the loyalty points within the Shopify platform they were already using for the online storefront? In a more advanced application of these features, Jean-Baptiste’s development team used Metafields to build the new loyalty point program, capturing customer loyalty point data inside a customer metafield. This also made it easier to streamline back-office operations by centralizing customer and purchasing data in one place.La Boutique MOSO gained many benefits from revamping their customer loyalty program data collection with Metafields, both for the customer experience and operational efficiencies, including:Faster product page building and loading speedsEnhanced online loyalty program experience for customersEasier back-office access to and integration of customer dataThe new loyalty program driven by Metafields is fast, simple, and fully integrated across the online store. Building customer loyalty points into a customer metafield leverages the flexibility of the Metafields feature and allows customers to easily access their loyalty points in multiple ways, including on their user account, within an email from the store or anywhere else the customer metafield is placed.“For us, it is a game changer, the Metafields. The products are doing much better. If the Metafields are properly structured and properly filled, we know that the product page has a much better conversion rate.”Jean-Baptiste Lainé, Co-founder, La Boutique MOSOThrough the proper use of classifying products and migrating that data to Metafields, the storefront’s administration and development was streamlined. “It's very easy to add a metafield or to add the classification without having to think about all the impact,” says Jean-Baptiste. Organization is easier through the admin sections of a Shopify store, and it’s easy to manage and create new catalogs.To learn more about how your storefront can make the most of Metafields, look out for our next use case or visit ourMetafields Help Center. Happy (Meta)fielding!"

A public listed app is also fully visible, because it's indexed and it appears in the following places: relevant category pages, Shopify App Store search results, and third-party search engine results.Public - Unlisted app: Merchants must install an unlisted app from an app listing page that uses a direct Shopify App Store URL , which is not visible or indexed on other surfaces.Custom apps: An app that is installed on a single Shopify store, which can be created from the Partner Dashboard or Shopify Admin. Shopify Plus service partners can install the same custom app on multiple Plus stores for a single Shopify Plus merchant.Deprecated app types:Unpublished app: Deprecated as of December 9, 2019. An unpublished app was a type of public app that one or many merchants could install and had all the same functionality as other public apps. However, the app didn't require any approval from Shopify.Learn more about the different types of Shopify appsShop Pay Installments allow merchants to buy now, pay later optionsShop Pay Installments now gives customers the option to pay in four interest-free biweekly payments or monthly installments up to 12 months.

With deferred purchase options, partners will be able to support merchants that want to allow payment and fulfillment to happen at different times.Learn more about the Selling APIShopify store admin domains are changingSpeed is at the forefront of everything we do. With that in mind, we have consolidated Shopify’s admin domains under a single domain: admin.shopify.com. This change reduces page reloads when you navigate the Shopify admin. You will notice this new domain and unique store extension in place of the usual myshopify.com URL. This will only change the URL that a merchant uses to access their store, it will not have any impact on the URLs in the APIs. Here are more important details:What are the impacts to admin URL structures?ThecurrentURLs are formatted as follows:Store Admin: [store-name].myshopify.com/admin/[page or resource path]Stores List: accounts.shopify.com/store-loginThenewURLs will be formatted as follows:Store Admin: admin.shopify.com/store/[store-name]/[page or resource path]Stores List: admin.shopify.comHere’s how to ensure your merchants won’t be affected:1. Have you included admin.shopify.com as an authenticated shop domain within your content security policy for your embedded apps?Apps on the Shopify App Store must set the proper Content Security Policy frame-ancestors directive to avoid clickjacking attacks. If you have not included the new admin.shopify.com domain as an authenticated shop domain, then your app will not load within the unified admin. Follow the steps described here to include the new domain in your content security policy.2. Have you upgraded your embedded apps to use App Bridge version 2.0?Embedded apps should upgrade to App Bridge 2.0 in order to use the new host parameter. This will allow the embedded app to work within the new admin domain. Otherwise, the merchant will be redirected to the old myshopify.com domain while using the app. This will be a disruptive experience for the merchant.3. Do any of your themes or apps reach outside the frame?If your theme reaches outside of the frame (e.g., referencing window.top.location), it will create issues within the theme editor once the domain changes. Instead, you should followthis documentationto be able to detect the theme editor. You can use any of the attributes listed here.Roll outWe are beginning to roll out to new merchants on July 5, 2022, and will start the roll out to existing merchants on July 19, 2022.Stay in the knowThat’s all for this month.

The feature also allows developers to display promotional content based on the buyer’s market. For example, a custom Thanksgiving announcement bar in October for Canadian buyers.Review the new APIComing soon: New parameter included in app proxies forwarded requestsStarting July 4th, app proxies forwarded requests will include a new parameter.Thelogged_in_customer_idparameter will be added to forwarded requests, which will add logged in customer’s information to the app proxy page.

A 422 error can be returned from a variety of scenarios, such as:Trying to write a read-only fieldEntering an integer where a string is expected (or boolean, etc.)Missing permissions/scopes for the operation being performedGeneral formatting issues (commas, parenthesis, etc.)Missing fields/values – Some operations require a field to be specified (like an object id) in either the payload or the endpoint URL. For example, missing fulfillmentOrder id when performing a fulfillment action on an order with multiple fulfillmentOrdersIf you encounter this error, carefully reference your payload data against our documentation and ensure that all fields are correctly formatted before trying again.See Shopify’s API responses and error codesDeveloper tip: Using development storesDevelopment stores are one of our most popular tools within the Partner Dashboard. They are used for testing and installing your apps and themes, providing example stores running your app for your listings, or as a template to create a store for a new Shopify merchant and to hand off and earn recurring revenue.Development stores are different from stores merchants create in several important ways. To start, as a Shopify Partner, you can create an unlimited number of free development stores. You'll start earning referral commissions on development stores after you transfer the store to the client. Also, there's no time limit on how long you can work on a development store. Clients only begin to pay for their stores once you transfer ownership and they select a paid plan.However, before you get started, there are some features and limitations to development stores that partners should know about.You can review them here.One more thing: Our support team often sees questions about connecting an existing store to your partner account. We can't retroactively affiliate an existing merchant store to your dashboard to earn revenue share. You must create the development store from within your partner dashboard first and then successfully transfer it to the client in order to receive revenue share.Check out our latest video and help center resources about creating development stores:VideosHow to transfer a Shopify development storeHow to create a Shopify development storeHelp CenterCreating development storesBuilding stores for merchantsRead about creating development storesHighlights from NYC developer workshopOn April 6, we brought the Shopify Developer NYC community together for the first time in almost two years for a night of learning and networking.Developers new and old joined Shopify for an ""Introduction to Building on Shopify"" workshop followed by a developer panel discussion with some of Shopify’s top developers in the ecosystem.

""I think for all businesses mobile-first is nice to have, but for the entrepreneur segment specifically, it's a need-to-have.""There's a lot that goes into making a mobile-first app solution. To help developers stake their piece of the fast-growing mobile commerce market, we've outlined three best practices to consider when building a mobile-first solution.Read more about mobile optimizationAdding more information to theme cardsIn order to help merchants make informed decisions about which theme may be best for their store, we have been testing ways to display useful theme information.This new design provides information on industry category, features and catalog size which can help merchants more quickly find themes that may suit their needs. Merchants can quickly toggle between theme presets to see different color and visual treatments on the theme card listing.This change will roll out across the theme store in the coming weeks.Learn more about theme cardsNew sync flag for the Shopify CLI serve commandWe've shipped a new sync flag for the Shopify CLI serve command which allows theme developers to synchronize updates between the remote theme and the local development theme.Now, developers using the Shopify CLI can capture changes that were made on the theme editor and apply these to their local development theme. Also, the feature is bi-directional, so developers can choose to overwrite the remote theme with changes made to the local development theme.This new feature launched in April with CLI version 2.15.2. Developers just need to update their version to get access to sync functionality.Learn more about the updateNew testing assets and documentation for theme developersTheme developers will now be able to access new testing tools and set up a testing environment which is very close to the environment that the Shopify theme review team uses to evaluate submissions. This will assist developers in auditing their theme and identifying issues before they submit their theme for review, thereby ensuring that the review process is faster and more streamlined. By testing and resolving issues, as well as checking that all features are present in your theme prior to submission, you can set yourself up for success on the Shopify Theme Store.Learn more about testing themesCase study: The Shopify 2021 App Challenge was the perfect opportunity for success for eVouchAuckland, New Zealand, based developer Eugene Yao knew word-of-mouth was an effective marketing tool, and if scaled with social media could help ecommerce brands reach new audiences. In this post, he shares how he used the Shopify App Challenge to scope, build, and deploy an app in just eight weeks.Read how they did itHelping merchants find apps through searchWe’re continuing to make improvements to the Shopify App Store search experience, to help merchants more easily find apps that meet their needs and requirements. A recent change we made helps logged in merchants find new apps.When a merchant is logged in, and searches for an app they already have installed, our search results will not show that app by default. There is a toggle in the left navigation that allows the merchant to choose to show “Already installed apps.” So, if a merchant searches for “grow order value,” they will see new apps that may help them achieve this goal.We are testing ways to help surface apps when searched for by the specific app name, and will refine the search experience further to help drive more high intent installs.Inspiring merchants with your themeAre you ready to build a Shopify Theme?

31,"We've got a big announcement that's been months in the making—Shopify Unite is coming back. But the event isn't going to be the way it used to be.This year, our focus is about meeting and making connections in person. So, instead of a single event in one city, Shopify Unite 2022 is going to be a series of three, two-day events held in locations around the world. ""We just launchedEditions, our new product showcase, as a way to share what we've done and where we're going,"" explains Dion Almaer, Shopify's VP of Engineering, Developer Experience, and a speaker at this year's events. ""But that doesn’t mean we don’t think it's important to get together in person and share. We want to come together with the community to help everyone be as successful as they can be on the platform.""Shopify Unite 2022 locations: London, Toronto, and MelbourneShopify Unite 2022 officially kicks off in London, England, on September 12th and 13th. A month later, the series moves to Toronto, Canada, on October 12th and 13th, and wraps up with a final stop in Melbourne, Australia, on October 26th and 27th. ""I think it's great that we're taking this event on the road, so it's more accessible for anyone who might be interested in joining,” says Megan Majewski, a Developer Advocate at Shopify and a first-time event attendee. “I'm excited to meet and connect with other Shopify developers. Getting in the same room with people in the community and hearing about what they’re building is so energizing.”The agendas for the Shopify Unite 2022 series are currently being built, but each event will feature sessions led by Shopify on the latest products for Shopify developers—including Shopify Functions, our tool to extend and customize Shopify features, and Hydrogen, our framework forheadless commerce—as well as guided hands-on workshops to help developers understand how to build on the platform. Each event will also feature one-on-one technical sessions, fireside chats, “unconference” time where attendees will decide the topics to discuss, and more.Magic really does happen when our ecosystem comes together.Liam Griffin, Senior Developer Advocate, ShopifyFor another first time Shopify Unite attendee, Jan Emge-Triebel—who recently joined the company as a Developer Manager for the Developer Advocacy team—the focus on recent product releases is particularly important. ""We've launched many features that have the potential to fundamentally change the way developers work with our platform,"" he says. ""That's one of the main reasons why I think it's important for the community to come together to learn about these concepts and push commerce forward together.""He adds: ""I want our developers to feel overwhelmed in the best way possible, and at the same time feel empowered to bring more features and brand new ideas to our merchants.""Building great software—and connections with the developer communityLiam Griffin, Senior Developer Advocate at Shopify, agrees that the product roadmap is important, but he's especially excited to talk to developers about it in person. ""The one thing I've missed the most is connecting in-person with members of the Shopify developer community,"" he explains. ""I'm really looking forward to sharing a coffee with developers, both new and experienced, to hear about their experiences and expectations. This year we'll have the opportunity to meet more developers from different regions around the world, and build connections in a way we've never done before.""A long-time developer advocate at Shopify, Liam gives a preview of what attendees can expect at the event series. ""This year, Shopify Unite will be more interactive than ever,"" he says. ""The Shopify developer community is a hugely collaborative one, and events like Shopify Unite make it possible for partners to connect, learn from each other, and build relationships. Prepare to make new friends and exchange ideas with some of the most talented and ambitious developers in the world. Magic really does happen when our ecosystem comes together.""Dion echoes Liam's comments, pointing out that Shopify Unite is most valuable and transformative—for developers, merchants, and the ecommerce industry as a whole–when the Shopify ecosystem shares and learns from each other. As he puts it: ""I know that the events will be good based on the content. I want the events to be great, and that will only happen if our developers show up as a community and we explore ideas and work together.""Learn moreTo learn more about Shopify Unite 2022,visit our event page. We’ll be updating and finalizing agendas and speaker lineups soon. We can’t wait to kick off Shopify Unite, reimagined for a new era in commerce."

The material you request will largely depend on what exists in their currentPOS system.To start planning the data migration, evaluate your client’s existing data and decide what needs to be moved. Listing the types of data your client’s old platform tracked can give you a good estimate of how many items will need to be moved over.Key information from you client can include:Gift cardsInventoryCustomer dataIn some cases, this info may be accessible through their current POS provider’s admin. However, in other cases, your client may need to contact their current POS provider and have the data exported and sent to them.Your client(s) may want to use this as an opportunity toclean up their inventory levels and do a fresh stock count. If they do, you’ll need to clean up any inventory levels prior to importing them to Shopify so that when it’s time to import product, customer, and gift card data, it’s in the merchant’s desired state.Migrate your client’s dataWhen a merchant migrates to Shopify POS, they need to transfer over existing data, like products, customers, gift cards, and/or orders.

33,"The world of ecommerce presents an almost endless supply of technology challenges to solve. At Shopify, we know we'll never be able to tackle all of them on our own. We need the help of developers like you to come up with new and innovative ways to help merchants thrive—all while forging your own path to success. That’s why we built Shopify Functions, a revolutionary new way to extend and replace backend Shopify logic with custom code to meet the business needs of any brand on Shopify.Introducing Shopify FunctionsWe thought long and hard about how we could offer more flexibility on Shopify while still providing a lightning-fast experience that can scale. Even though our frontend was already extensible with Liquid and Hydrogen, and the database layer was accessible through APIs and metafields, Shopify’s backend application logic has historically been locked down.Not anymore.With Shopify Functions we’ve created a radical new way to build unique commerce experiences by allowing developers to inject custom code into Shopify’s backend logic. Since Functions run inline on Shopify’s global infrastructure, they can meet the demands of the biggest sales events on the planet, while still executing in under 5ms. With Functions, you can have it all: the flexibility of open source platforms, without the hassle of managing hosting, security, and forked code.Powerful Functions capabilities available to all Shopify merchantsAfter powering ecommerce businesses for over 16 years, we know how critical it is to differentiate from the competition with unique discounts, promotions, and buying experiences. In fact, we know that brands on Shopify Plus see a 20% increase to their average order value when they use Shopify Scripts discount, shipping, and payment method customizations. We also know that the more successful the brand is, the more likely they are to rely on Scripts for custom functionality.However, Scripts did have some challenges. Namely, Scripts are exclusive to Shopify Plus, meaning it was only available to our largest merchants. Additionally, Scripts required end users to be fluent in Ruby code to both create and modify discount, shipping, or payment gateway customizations. Looking to the future, we built Functions with these challenges in mind.First and foremost,Functions are available to all merchants on Shopify, not just Plus. Secondly, Functions are installed with an app and can be sold in theShopify App Store. This means that as of today, you can start building discount apps with Functions and sell them to millions of merchants on Shopify, a completely untapped market.But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In addition to dramatically increasing the total addressable market for backend customizations, we’ve also made them so much easier to use. With Functions, ecommerce managers and marketers never have to write (or even see) code. Instead, Functions are installed like any other app and then configured directly in the Admin alongside out-of-the-box Shopify features. Meaning, discount Functions will be visible under the discount settings, shipping Functions under shipping, and so on.Taking this model a step further, let’s look at a discount example. WithDiscount Combinations, merchants can create unique promotions by combining a custom bulk discount—built with Functions—and Shopify’s out-of-the-box free shipping discount. The ability to mix and match custom discounts and native discounts is exclusive to Functions, giving it a huge advantage over current discount apps in the App Store.The power of Functions doesn’t stop there; any discount built with Functions will be accessible in Shopify Analytics sales reporting. So merchants will finally have a single source of truth when reviewing their discount strategies. This capability is a big deal for merchants as it streamlines reporting and makes it faster and easier to see if their recent promotions were successful or not. It’s important to note that this attribute is also unique to Functions, and is not available to discount apps that are built with draft orders.How to build FunctionsThe three key building blocks for Shopify Functions include:Flexible UI—built withApp Bridgeand ReactData storage and configuration—useMetafieldsBackend logic—Functions codeTo ensure that Functions provide a lightning fast and reliable experience, we built a brand newWebAssemblyplatform for them to run on. Meaning, Functions is up to any critical task—stores going viral, internet-breaking flash sales—you name it, Functions can handle it.Discount Functions available now and Payment and Shipping coming soonWe’ve already talked aboutdiscounts, which Functions allows you to configure directly in the Shopify admin, so merchants never need to touch a line of code.Here are the other domains that Shopify Functions supports or will support in the near future:Discount APIs—product and order discount APIs available nowMore specifically, you can customize the order discount, product discount, and shipping discount APIsTo give you a couple of popular ideas, brands have long been interested in volume discounts based on the number of items purchased, as well as free gift with purchase offers when a specific dollar threshold is reachedShipping Customization API—coming soonHide, reorder, or create new shipping optionsFor example, in the case of an eco-friendly brand, bike shipping or local pickup could be displayed as the primary shipping options for any buyer within a specific zip or postal code radius.Payment Customization API—coming soonHide or reorder payment optionsOne of the most popular instances of a payment method customization is setting a specific dollar threshold to determine when a cash-on-hand payment option is available in the checkoutWe’re starting out with familiar customization areas, but our plan is to offer significantly more Functions options in the future. For example, we’re already investigating how we could add support for order routing, checkout and cart validations, return validations, and shipping rates, just to name a few.Start to explore everything you can do with FunctionsAs you can see, we’ve been laser focused on providing a radical new way to build fast, scalable, and unique commerce experiences. With Functions, you now have the power to extend Shopify and build capabilities that we’ve never dreamt about. Keep in mind that this is just the start of the journey, and be on the lookout as we make more of Shopify’s backend logic extensible with Functions.If you’re eager to start building your first Shopify Function, you can learn more in ourdeveloper documentation, or jump right in and write your first product or order Discount Function by following along withour tutorial. We can’t wait to see what you’ll build."
34,"For years, Shopify has helped merchants of all sizes deliver the most reliable, highest-converting checkout on the planet. Fast, intuitive, and simple, Shopify Checkout has set the standard for what a checkout should be, while Shop Pay, our accelerated checkout, delivers a buying experience that's four times faster—and a conversion rate that's 11% higher—than the competition.The only problem? Customizing Shopify Checkout was a slow and painful process, making it difficult for brands and Shopify Partners to adapt Shopify Checkout to meet unique business needs—until now.Build apps for Shopify merchantsWhether you want to build apps for the Shopify App Store, offer custom app development services, or are looking for ways to grow your user base, the Shopify Partner Program will set you up for success. Join for free and access educational resources, developer preview environments, and recurring revenue share opportunities.Sign upThe old way to customize Shopify CheckoutOptimized for over 16 years, Shopify Checkout is built for speed and conversion right out of the box. It also includes built-in features for adding express checkouts, local payment methods, tipping options, and more. But as brands grow, they may want to make more advanced customizations to their checkout—whether they're trying to increase average order value or comply with local business regulations.In the past, Shopify Plus brands could make advanced customizations to the look and functionality of their checkout by requesting access to theircheckout.liquidtheme file and directly editing the code. This required working with a developer to build bespoke customizations, or a cumbersome process for installing partner customizations.Checkout.liquiddidn't provide direct APIs for making changes to Shopify Checkout, often resulting in sub-par buyer experiences and poor performance. Developers also needed to perform periodic upgrades to customized checkouts in order to access new features without breaking any customizations.This method of customizing Shopify Checkout was both time-consuming and expensive—so our team invested in a faster, upgrade-safe way for brands to customize their checkout.The new way to customize Shopify CheckoutWe wanted to make it faster and easier for Shopify Plus brands to customize their checkout—while offering even more opportunity for developers to build creative solutions for Shopify Checkout. So we built a way for brands to customize their checkout using powerful apps and branding tools instead of editing code.Checkout extensibilitymakes it easier for Shopify Plus merchants to customize their checkout in a way that’s app-based, upgrade-safe, higher-converting, and integrated with Shop Pay. It includes a suite of powerful platform features that give brands the ability to make code-free customizations to their checkout using apps. And it also gives them the flexibility to build the exact experience they want by developing custom apps for bespoke customizations using a collection of components and APIs.This is where developers come in. For the first time, Shopify is unlocking the ability for developers to deploy checkout customizations through a custom app or public app on theShopify App Store.Withcheckout UI extensions, you can add elements to Shopify Checkout like product offers, custom fields, custom content, loyalty programs, and more. These extensions show up in guest checkout and Shop Pay, creating a unified experience for buyers wherever they choose to check out. Moreover, you don’t have to worry about duplicating branding settings in your app because extensions automatically inherit the branded appearance of the store’s checkout.Checkout UI extensions automatically adapt to the various checkout flows, creating a unified experience for buyers wherever they choose to check out.Checkout UI extensions are adaptable to various flows, creating a unified experience for buyers wherever they choose to checkout.Shopify Functionsgive you the flexibility to extend or replace native Shopify server-side business logic so you can customize the discounts applied to orders, products, or shipping. For example, you could build a Function that provides tiered discount options, such as spend $100 get $20 off. And soon, you'll be able to build Shopify Functions that include cart validations.You can also build apps for Shopify Checkout that track customer events using theweb pixel app extensionand apps that add a post-purchase page to checkout usingpost-purchase extensions.And finally, brands can make advanced customizations to the appearance of their checkout using theBranding API. While they can use the checkout editor to make basic customizations, like customizing the colors and fonts in their checkout, the branding API opens the door to a world of possibilities. For example, brands can add their favicon or completely customize the corner radius on any buttons in their checkout.UI extensions automatically inherit a merchant’s brand settings.Checkout extensibility is built on the latest platform technology, allowing for a faster checkout experience that results in up to 1% higher conversion on average. And the UI components and APIs that power checkout extensibility run in a sandboxed environment, giving brands additional security—unlike the old way of customizing Shopify Checkout.Out with the old, in with the newToday, checkout extensibility is available for in-checkout pages, which include the Information, Shipping, and Payment pages of checkout. It empowers merchants and developers to build creative, upgrade-safe customizations for Shopify Checkout, replacing the need forcheckout.liquid.As a result,checkout.liquidis deprecated and will no longer work for in-checkout pages on August 13, 2024. Any brands that customize their in-checkout pages withcheckout.liquidwill need to upgrade to checkout extensibility.This opens an exciting opportunity for developers to help brands bybuilding apps that extend Shopify Checkoutorupgrading brands to checkout extensibility.Brands can continue customizing their post-checkout pages, which includes their Thank You Page and Order Status Page, withcheckout.liquidfor now. However, they’ll soon be able to customize these pages using checkout extensibility. This functionality is currently indeveloper preview.Have any feedback on checkout extensibility?Share it on Github."
35,"Since day one, Shopify has been on a mission to make commerce better for everyone. We believe that building a business should be easy, that the tools for running that business should be simple, and that everyone who contributes to the commerce ecosystem should always put customers first.With data breaches and other types of fraud on the rise, we are also keenly aware that security is critical to building and operating an ecommerce business for merchants and developers alike. We are committed to building the safest commerce platform in the world, and as part of that effort,we are implementing updated requirements for apps that use customer personal data. With these updates, developers will have easier access to the data they need, quickly and at scale. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's changing.New Requirements for Apps that Use Customer Personal DataAt Shopify, we require data minimization practices as part of our privacy by design approach to commerce, meaning developers should only request the minimum amount of data needed to make their apps function properly.To reinforce this approach, in the 2022-10 release, APIs will redact customer personal data by default and allow you to apply for necessary access to customer personal data as needed to provide intended app functionality to merchants. These changes will enable your app to better support a business’s path towards compliance with privacy and data protection rules.We're publishing our protected customer data requirements before the release of API version 2022-10 to help developers prepare. In line with our regularAPI versioningand depreciation timelines, existing apps will have until July 1st, 2023, to migrate to API version 2022-10.Our approach to data protectionIn the coming release, Shopify will limit an app's data access to only the required resources and fields.Protected customer dataincludes any data that relates directly to a customer or prospective customer, as represented in the API resources. This includes information like total order value, line items in an order, and order shipping events. Apps that require this level of data must implement ourdata protection requirements, including informing merchants of your app’s data use and purpose, applying customer consent decisions, opt-out requests, and more.Protected customer fieldsrequire individual configuration and approval, in addition to approval for protected customer data. This includes information like name, address, email, and phone number. Apps that require this layer of data will need to abide byadditional requirements, including encrypting your data back ups, keeping test and production data separate, and more.A new way to access protected dataWe will be sharing details in advance of the new process for apps to request protected data in the partner dashboard. If your app does not use protected data, you can simply update to the latest API version. If your app does use this data, Shopify will approve your use of the minimum amount needed to provide the merchant with the app functionality. If you're approved for all the data that you requested, then no code updates are required. If you're not approved for the data you requested, then you might need to update your app to handle errors or redacted data.Shopify allows you to apply for necessary access to customer personal data throughout the life of your app.Looking aheadIn August 2022, we will publish reference documentation for unstable APIs that contain protected customer data.

Here’s a list of helpful features to show your clients the full power of using Shopify online and in-store:Customer profilesSyncing customer profiles for both online and in-store activities, Shopify POS creates an information-rich database for your client to manage their customer relationships. Your client’s store staff and managers can use information from a customer’s online profile and tailor the in-store experience to fit that customer’s needs. Merchants can also better understand their customers’ buying habits and provide a better post-purchase experience based on the context provided from a customer’s profile. Unifying the customer experience across all storefronts and touchpoints can lead to increased customer acquisition and retention, ultimately lifting sales and revenue.Learn how customer profiles helped merchant Kowtow grow in-store sales by 30%.Products and inventory managementProducts and their inventory levels can be managed from one admin, with Shopify. This means no more inventory discrepancies across systems. Inventory can be customized per location and inventory at other locations can be easily seen from the Product details page within POS. This will empower sales associates to help customers get the products they want or need. Bulk inventory adjustments can be made inside the Shopify admin and are immediately available on the Shopify POS app, in-store. This makes stock takes and updating inventory easy.Learn more about inventory management.Smart gridThe Shopify POS smart grid provides merchants with a customizable point of sale interface. We suggest showing clients how they can create custom tiles for things like discounts, popular products, apps, creating customer profiles, and more. The smart grid can always be customized and becomes a powerful tool for common in-store actions.Local pickupShopify POS can bolster your client’s buy online, pickup in-store (BOPIS) capabilities and make it a more cohesive experience for customers. Not only that, but retail staff can also easily view and prepare orders in the POS system, notify customers once their order is ready, and mark orders as fulfilled once it has been received. Streamlining BOPIS ensures that your client stays on top of their operations, inventory, and customer satisfaction. Learn more about local pickuphere.Staff permissionsA growing business means a growing team, which oftentimes means growing pains. Shopify POS takes the pain out of team growth with its staff permissions feature, which lets your client set limits on what store associates can and can’t do when logged into the POS, like changing inventory levels or a product’s price. At the same time, store managers and owners still have access to the information needed to do their job, like scheduling, managing payroll, and applying discounts. Setting permissions allows your clients to delegate the right responsibilities to the right team member, thus making sure all parts of their organization run as smoothly as possible.Learn more about staff permissions.In-store analyticsShopify POS provides in-store level analytics and insights into net sales, net sales by staff, average order value, average items per order, and top products bynet salesfor store managers.

37,"Delays and shortages across every area of shipping—containers, drivers, fuel, etc.—have led to rapidly rising costs. The global energy crisis is impacting the availability of all kinds of products, especially in manufacturing hubs like China. Increased demand has caused bottlenecks at ports around the world, while the lack of available drivers means there may be no one to deliver goods to their next destination. And ever-changing health regulations and restrictions due to the global pandemic are still further complicating the supply chain.It’s a huge logistical challenge for merchants around the globe. If you don't have the product, you simply can't service the customer. So for this article, we talked to a few Shopify Partners to find out what the clients they work with are currently dealing with, and how agencies can help merchants solve supply chain issues.The Global Supply Chain PlaybookThe impact of the global shipping crisis“We heard all kinds of stories from our clients,” Chris Pointer, founder and CEO of Shopify design and development firmPointer Creative, explains. “Some had products that were totally hung up overseas, and they were considering desperate measures to sell them, like turning to marketplaces like Amazon, because they just couldn’t get them to North America to distribute through their direct-to-consumer channel. This approach dilutes sales but especially if you have seasonal products at least you can get them moved.”Shipping container shortages have caused prices to soar. In 2019 it costless than $2,000to transport goods from Asia to the United States in a 40-foot container. By October 2021, the same service cost around $10,000—or even up to $25,000 if an importer paid for the luxury of “on-time delivery,” a cost that’s invariably passed down to merchants.The container shortage has led to bizarre situations at ports. Even if there was a container, there was no guarantee that a merchant’s products would actually make it onto the ship. “Some companies hired staff on the ground to monitor shipping containers,” Robert Befumo, head of ecommerce strategy atParkfield Commerce, recalls. “They were there to make sure that their goods were not being moved off a container and replaced with cargo from another business. It’s like the floor of the stock market in some ports, the container goes to the highest bidder. So while you may be able to follow your supply chain logistically andthinkthat it’s shipping, in reality it might actually not be.”Container prices have started to come down over the past six months, but because supply is still limited and COVID-19 still causing shutdowns around the world, prices are not expected to approach pre-pandemic rates again until 2023 at the earliest.Even once systems do normalize, the events of the last couple of years have exposed significant global logistic network vulnerabilities to political instability, natural disasters, and regulatory changes. In fact,according to McKinseysupply chain disruptions now occur every 3.7 years on average.You might also like:Shipping Delays and the Holiday Rush: How to Set Your Business Up for Success.How to respond to increased customer expectationsOne solution is to invest in domestic production but it’s costly and takes time to set up. Bigger brands also take matters into their own hands by chartering their own ships to avoid shipping container backlogs, but these approaches are not suitable for every merchant, especially small- to midsize companies.“Ecommerce merchants with reliable supply chains currently enjoy an advantage over under-supplied competitors, while brands that can afford to use air freight enjoy an advantage over brands that ship by sea,” explains David Wagoner, co-founder and CMO offull-service ecommerce agencyP3 Media.He continues: “Merchants facing supply issues that can’t be ameliorated with a transfer air freight need to prepare for additional shipping delays by building out clear communication touchpoints around fulfillment, and emphasizing pre-orders online.”While certainly challenging, shipping disruptions are also an opportunity to improve and get creative with how you communicate and solve supply chain issues. Brands that can innovate in this area and keep their customers in the loop have a big competitive differentiator. As a result they are going to see better conversion rates and lower return rates.Just offering free delivery isn’t enough anymore. If brands aren’t able to fulfill their delivery promise, or aren’t clear around shipping, customers will simply walk away. According to a study conducted for Shopify’sFuture of Commercereport, 32 percent of customers abandoned their carts in 2021 because “the estimated shipping time was too long,” and 23 percent because “there was no guaranteed delivery date.”Five future-proof best practices for smoother fulfillmentWe asked P3 Media’s Wagoner how partners can support their clients while reducing the stress of fulfillment and safeguarding their supply chains for the future. Here he recommends five fulfillment-focused best practices that merchants can employ to maximize sales and engagement:1. Build additional customer touchpoints around fulfillment delaysIn 2021, consumers all over the world got accustomed to waiting longer to receive their online orders. And withproduction, shipping, and on-shore transportation all in flux, shoppers have also learned to tolerate more “out of stock” notifications.However, Wagoner warns that shoppers haven’t grown accustomed to placing an order and then waiting weeks or months for a simple update. Uncertainty is much worse than being aware of a delay. “To keep waiting customers happier, brands need to introduce clear, timely messaging around delays that informs customers when they can expect to receive their goods, and gives them the opportunity to modify or cancel their orders,” he advises.Effective channels for distributing transparent fulfillment updates include:The homepage promo barTransactional email flowsSMS campaignsAutomatingorder notification emailsand text messages, for example, make it easy for customers to track their orders, so they know when they have been received, packaged, and sent out for delivery. Customers can also use theShop appto access up-to-the-minute tracking information for their order, and anticipate or mitigate delays.Shopify’s Online Store then enables you to add sections to the product page that clearlyarticulate shipping and return policies, which makes it easy to set delivery expectations from the moment the customer starts browsing straight through to checkout.Meanwhile,providing shipping speedshelps create transparent checkout experiences that improve the customer experience and reduceshopping cart abandonment.P3 Media client Grayers sent an email to customers to inform them of their holiday sale and possible shipping delays.2. Leverage pre-order and “notify when available” functionalityWagoner believes that brands experiencing significant product delays will benefit from setting uppre-order functionalityor using a third-partyrestockapp to add “notify me when available” email and SMS collection fields directly to the product detail page.“Transforming ‘out of stock’ messaging into a pre-order opportunity allows brands to continue generating monthly recurring revenue around core products that often go out of stock, accurately gauge demand for significantly delayed goods, or grow anticipation around a new release,” Wagoner points out.Restock notification apps function similarly, but instead of collecting customers’ credit card information, they collect customer emails and phone numbers. Wagoner says that restock apps can be particularly useful to merchants interested in building contact lists of qualified prospects.“But be sure not to send any campaign messages to the prospects on these lists without collecting their consent first,” he cautions. “Signing up for a restock notification is not the same as signing up to receive marketing communications, and you’ll need explicit permission if you want to use the personal information collected through a restock app for marketing purposes.”Clothing brand Merz b. Schwanen added a ‘notify me’ button to their product detail page to give customers the option to be alerted when a requested item is back in stock.3. Offer blended fulfillment options and bring inventory closer to customersOngoing supply chain woes and exorbitant shipping costs mean it’s taking longer for most brands to on-shore goods. While merchants can’t do much to fix the global supply chain, Wagoner suggests any merchant with a brick-and-mortar presence can offer accelerated local fulfillment options that will differentiate them from competitors.On Shopify, brands with physical stores or local stockists can now leverage these in-real-life outposts to make last-mile fulfillment much more convenient. Two great ways to do this are toset up blended local checkout optionslike buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS), or to transform physical locations into shipping hubs by setting up simplelocal deliveryprograms. Both are fully integrated within the Shopify admin and the Shopify POS app.“In essence, use your brick and mortar stores as fulfillment centers,” Wagoner recommends. “It can be a real competitive differentiator for direct-to-consumer and digitally native brands.”Gap is offering two new blended fulfillment options to its customers: Buy online, pick up curbside and buy online, pick up in-store.Jason Wong, founder of cruelty-free beauty brandDoe Lashes, meanwhile suggests also analyzing the customer data to figure out where customers are placing their orders from. “We responded to the data by placing our inventory near the key cities we uncovered, which reduces the miles our packages need to travel,” he explains. “If you only fulfill from one facility, a single order could travel thousands of miles to reach its destination. That’s a huge carbon footprint. So we send a large shipment to New York, for example, because that’s where we have a lot of customers, and another one to California. As a result, products travel a shorter distance, there are fewer carbon emissions, and the cost is lower for both our business and the consumers.”One option is to outsourceinventory managementand fulfillment. TheShopify Fulfillment Network, for example, takes care of picking, packing, and shipping orders for merchants, so they can spend more time managing their business. You can also optimize order management with the ShopifyFulfillment Orders APIto create a better fulfillment experience for your clients, no matter how or where they fulfill orders.You might also like:Supply Chain Issues? How Going Local Can Help.4. Automate fulfillment logicIf your clients manage orders manually, you can return hundreds of hours to them and vastly improve their customer experience just by usingShopify Flow.The platform allows merchants to automate workflow rules aroundcustomer tagging,order payments,inventory alertslike low-stock notifications, andfraud detection. Automating order-related processes minimizes purchase fraud and returns while accelerating fulfillment. On the flipside, you can also use automations to stop campaigns promoting out-of-stock products.“With its intuitive interface and robust app integrations, Flow can empower your clients to streamline their online operations with no coding required,” Wagoner says. “Plus, automation frees up valuable time for the team to focus on creative and strategic areas of the business instead.”Shopify Flow enables you to set up automatic low inventory email alerts when the product quantity reaches a certain threshold.You might also like:Automate Everything with Shopify Flow.5. Set up cross-border sellingOver Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2021,15 percent of saleswere cross-border. That figure is only expected to rise as online shoppers continue exploring ways to source products difficult to obtain from on-shore retailers.“Well-supplied brands currently have a chance to maximize their stock advantage by entering markets where demand for their wares is heaviest, but as with all arbitrage opportunities, time is of the essence,” Wagoner points out. He recommends Shopify Plus merchants tapShopify Marketsand theirnine included expansion storesto expand to global markets quickly while maintaining control over their customer relationships.Expansion stores can be managed centrally from Shopify’s “organization admin” view, while stores set up using Markets can handle currency conversion, translation, duty and tax management, and price lists automatically. The ability to use a brand’s existingecommerce logisticsand web experience to build a fully functional international storefront greatly reduces time to launch, and streamlines the tasks of store management.P3 recently created a Canadian storefront for DTC denim retailerMott & Bow, set up with Shopify Markets. Since launching both core and Markets stores on Shopify Online Store 2.0, Mott & Bow has seen a sharp YOY revenue increase, with much of that growth driven by international conversions.You might also like:Shopify Markets: Everything You Need to Sell Worldwide.Support your clients in adapting to constant changeDon’t wait for things to go back to “normal.” Some things have changed for good. A shift towards increased domestic and more sustainable production now seems inevitable, for example. The global disruption to supply chain issues has also shown that it’s now more important than ever to help merchants streamline their logistics, for the short-andthe long term. At the same time, as customer expectations have risen significantly, it’s essential to manage them both by being more transparent and by offering more fulfillment options as a competitive differentiator.Merchants have to deal with a lot of uncertainty around the shipping of their products, and the more partner agencies can take that weight off them, the more merchants can adapt and continue to serve their customers. Follow the best practices outlined in this article, and you’ll be well prepared to support your clients for current and future fulfillment challenges.Learn more:Check outShopify’s report on The Future of Shipping and Logisticsfor more trends, insights, and advice you need to succeed in 2022."
38,"Consumer behavior is changing rapidly, and as the number of brands coming online has exploded in recent years, offering a myriad of options to customers, differentiation is now a significant key to success.According toresearch from McKinsey, over 60 percent of global consumers have changed shopping behavior during the pandemic. In the US it was even higher—75 percent—and the top three reasons for shopping for a new brand in the US were: value, availability, and convenience. What a brand stands for is also important: Shopify’s recentFuture of Commerce reportfound that 52 percent of global shoppers are more likely to purchase from a company with shared values.The days of squeaking by with a sub-par website and poor communication are clearly over. It’s no longer enough to just compete on price or a specific product feature. The bar keeps getting set higher and higher, and it’s essential to not just help merchants meet customers’ expectations, but also exceed them.We polled some trusted Shopify Partners and industry leaders to find out what it takes to stand out from the crowd in 2022.Check out Commerce Trends 2023The 2023 edition of Shopify’s annual report is now available. Learn about the latest trends shaping commerce, pulled from proprietary data, insider experts, and top global brands.See report1. Help merchants bring their brand story to the forefrontTrying to appeal to everyone can come off as bland and colorless. The best brands today are standing out by being passionate and authentic. Ben Jabbawy, founder and CEO ofPrivy, says that the brand story is one of your merchant’s most important assets when it comes to differentiation.“As an independent brand, you are not Amazon or Wayfair, and there was a reason you started this business,” Jabbawy says. “Maybe you were passionate about your product or your service and left your job to work on it. So tell that story and help build that connection.”Advise your merchants to start by finding out what theircompetitors are doing, and then tell a story that is uniquely their own. Focus all of your marketing efforts on the story and bring it to life to build better relationships with your customers.Telling a compelling brand story is going to help merchants reach the next level and differentiate their business from everyone else. By way of example, Jabbawy points toBaraka Shea Butter(also check out Jabbawy’s interview with Baraka founder Wayne Dunn inthis episodeof his Ecommerce Marketing School podcast).“It’s not a well-known brand, but revenues are growing quickly,” Jabbawy says. “They anchor their website, email program, packaging inserts, and everything else around the women hand-making the products. Baraka’s success is their success. The products are fantastic, but what converts the customer is the story behind the product itself. Putting it front and center helped them significantly grow sales. The story became the focal point throughout the tactical marketing execution.”Create a unique brand identity to cut through the noiseDigital consultantKate Collinsonbelieves that capturing the brand story and personality is critical. “I think investing in branding is a really important exercise. It's what's separating a lot of businesses who are excelling and growing at a rapid rate versus businesses that are just getting by,” she says.However, the process of nailing that branding doesn’t always happen as effortlessly as your merchants might hope. That’s when it may make sense for your merchants to conduct internal workshops with employees, or partner with an outside contractor.“Really hone in on that brand identity or that brand bible to cover who you are, why you are, what you bring, and what you look like to customers,” Collinson says. “I strongly encourage it as it builds a really solid foundation for growing businesses who need to onboard new staff, especially when working with third-party contractors.”Collinson advises that it’s vitally important to conduct competitive research and understand where stores sit within the market landscape. “Why do you deserve a place there? What sets you apart? Is it price, quality, value, content, or meaning and purpose?”Kate Collinson recommends Simon Sinek’s book and TED talk Start with Why as a great place to start building a brand identity from.Andrew Bialecki, founder ofKlaviyo, stresses that the best thing you can do is not to try to be anything but yourself. Customers now hold brands to a much higher standard, and it’s essential to engage with them in ways that feel authentic.“Successful brands, and this is true not just in retail but for all industries all over the world, have a strong opinion,” he explains. “They let their personality show through and what’s near and dear to them. A good exercise is just writing it down: Ask your friends and family to describe you in four or five words. Is it the same as for your brand? What’s different and why? Then make sure that either you have an element of humor, something interesting, or a certain expertise that you can offer that will stand out.”Tell the brand’s sustainability storyOne of the largest opportunities to create a meaningful point of differentiation is to talk about the sustainable business practices the merchant is implementing: according to theFuture of Commerce report, nearly half of customers chose to buy brands that have a clear commitment to environmentally-friendly values in 2021.Kyle Monk, director of insights at theBritish Retail Consortium, believes that a brand’s purpose is increasingly important in helping customers make a purchasing decision. What a brand does beyond just selling a product or service to keep customers coming back has to be very easily discernible.“Look at Body Shop,” he suggests. “The company very clearly stands for ethical consumption, sustainable packaging, and protecting ecosystems. That’s their purpose, and that will resonate with people. Think about the brand equity and what makes you different. If it’s sustainability credentials, put them front and center. Make sure that it’s very clear in all your communication. Price is very hard to beat, but you can also compete through specialism and sharing the reasons someone might be interested in buying a particular product. Content goes a long way.”To find out how to conduct a sustainability storytelling audit on an online store, check out the chapter by Shopify’s senior manager of social impact, Katie Boothby-Kung, in the ‘Sustainable Ecommerce Handbook’.Sustainability-centered toilet paper company Reel has a separate page that explains why it favors bamboo over trees.2. Consider the customer journey from start to finishAs advertising costs continue to climb, investing more in the customer experience has become a key part of customer acquisition. Chelsea Jones, founder ofChelsea & Rachel Co., recommends thinking of your site and the interaction with your consumers as an artwork.“The more you can engage as a brand, the better it's going to be,” she advises. “Start thinking in terms of how the brand is engaging with customers. If you don't, you're going to be just lost in the mess. Everyone is now online, it’s expected from you. But how do you actually engage with your customers in a way that makes sense to your purpose and your goals?”To retain customers, grow your (clients’) business, and leave the competition behind, it’s crucial to think about the entire customer journey. Highlight unique differentiators at every customer touchpoint, and ensure you create a consistent end-to-end customer experience across all digital channels.Andreas Wächter, founder ofbeeclever, says that brands need to be creative to set themselves apart and reach customers. “Merchants need to care about the UX/UI design as well as the fulfillment and product quality,” he advises. “This will become so much more important in the future. No matter which industry you’re in, find creative ways to engage with your customers emotionally for the very first touchpoint until you send them an email thanking them for their purchase.”Don’t neglect the post-purchase journeySharon Goldstein, CEO of ecommerce conversion data networkLimeSpot, points out that direct-to-consumer channels in particular are an opportunity to create a unique unboxing experience that customers will remember.“As marketplace shipments are generic, unboxing experiences are a place to shine,” she suggests. “Include colored paper, free samples or gifts, in-box notes, or coupons. Unboxing is something that customers look forward to and will encourage them to make future purchases directly from your site.”Giovanna Fariello, product marketing lead for shipping services at Shopify, agrees that it’s important to differentiate the customer experience beyond the checkout. “You hear a lot about packages being taken off people’s porches, right from in front of their door,” she explains. “This is an opportunity for merchants to improve their shipping. Is there a low cost way to insure the packages for theft, damage, or loss, for example? There’s usually a cost associated with replacing the product. Time and energy go into the customer’s claim. But if the packages are already insured, it makes it so much easier and creates a better experience, not only for the customers but also for the merchant and their staff.”Hot sauce store Heatonist collaborated with the Shopify Fulfillment Network to be able to continue to ship products in custom packaging at scale.3. Make the most of the digital experienceAs more people buy online (the global ecommerce market is expected to total a mind-boggling$5.55 trillionin 2022), a smooth digital experience that helps show the products in the best possible way is also essential.Kelly Vaughn, founder ofThe Taproom, explains that your merchant’s website will likely be the catalyst for whether or not customers complete a purchase. “If you want to differentiate yourself from other brands, whether you're brand new or you're a legacy brand entering into this ecommerce space now, setting your store experience apart online is going to be really important,” she says.This goes beyond website navigation. It also encompasses the level of customer service that can be experienced on the site.Copper Cow Coffee, for example, offers shoppers a custom quiz flow to help them build a subscription based on their coffee tastes, whileRacefacefocuses on a custom UX/UI, a truly fast site, and easy item discoverability with smart filtering and product comparison.For merchants offering more high-end products building cutting-edge ecommerce sites and apps is slightly more complex but they can take advantage of emerging technology like augmented or virtual reality and chatbots to enhance the customer experience with interactive features.“Shopping for luxury items online doesn’t have the same personal touch that you’d get shopping for a luxury item in a physical store like Hermés, for example,” Vaughn explains. “When you’re shopping for an item that costs hundreds or thousands of dollars and you can’t try it on or feel it, it can be more difficult to make that purchasing decision.”Vaughn recommends brands can bridge this by offering pre-purchase customer service. International fashion houseAkris, for example, has an AI assistant to help customers explore products, and personal skincare companyDermalogicaenables shoppers to chat with a “professional skin therapist"" to figure out which products they need to purchase.“These kinds of experiences stick with customers, and it's going to incentivize them to come back and also tell their friends to shop there as well.”You might also like:What to Consider When Planning a Website Redesign.The Taproom worked with specialty Vietnamese coffee brand Copper Cow Coffee to create a personalized subscription quiz-flow to engage customers.Build a mobile-first storeThese days, most customers are shopping on mobile devices. How well a website works on mobile is therefore a huge factor in driving sales. “Mobile transactions made up about 73 percent of all ecommerce sales worldwide in 2021,” points out David Wagoner, co-founder and CMO ofP3 Media.He continues: “We’ve been talking about mobile-first design for a decade but it’s now more important than ever to invest in your mobile experience and really treat this as an iterative process. Once you update your mobile site, it doesn't stop there, you have to continue to improve that process to deliver better experiences to your customers.”To optimize the mobile performance of an online store, Wagoner recommends auditing it regularly across four key dimensions—third-party apps, mobile cart experience, dynamic loading, and extraneous code—and conduct extensive user testing to find out how to better address the needs and desires of your clients’ target customers.Wagoner also believes that site speed is now a competitive differentiator. “Speeding up your website by just one second can increase conversion rates by up to seven percent. Consumers now expect faster sites, and companies like Google prioritize site speed as a metric that they really care about both on the consumer and brand side.”You might also like:How Mobile Commerce Is Transforming UX and CX Forever.4. Personalize what you offer to customersFinally, merchants should keep in mind that while they may only sell one set of products or services, they may have many different types of customers that have different needs and wishes. Consumers now expect the website experience to be personalized and relevant to them, so both the selection of products and the communication should be tailored accordingly to really connect with the target audience.“The millennial generation in particular can hardly be won over by the one-size-fits-all approach,” beeclever’s Andreas Wächter says. “Think about product customization, bundle-building, and mix and match opportunities that make your offerings more customizable for consumers.”Here it can be a real advantage to be a smaller merchant. It enables you to make fast decisions and provides you with the flexibility to experiment, for example with product recommendations and site segmentation to make shoppers feel known, assist in discovery, and increase conversions.A smaller size also makes it easier to talk directly to customers, be personal, and identify with them in a way that more faceless brands aren’t able to. That human connection is very valuable and helps to surround products with a sense of community.“The smaller the business, the easier it is to create personal activities,” explains Simon Kemp, founder and CEO of strategic marketing consultancyKepios. “The more that I feel special, the more I am likely to engage. If I feel that I’m part of something and that that person cares, I’ll pay attention and reciprocate it. That’s just how it works, and it’s not scalable in most instances. There’s a lot of technology out there that helps you with personalization but if you’re a small merchant with a personal touch, it’s like the coffee shop on the corner that remembers my name. It’s exactly the same concept.”The brands that speak to everyone speak to no oneIn today’s competitive ecommerce landscape, the resilient retailers who continue to try new strategies and use their data to figure out what works for them are going to thrive. This is the time to compete not on price, but on brand and value proposition.A strong, unique brand identity, clear values, and how you communicate that story and what your (client’s) business stands for are critical differentiators. Use the technology that’s at your disposal but in creative ways, always asking yourself how it’s going to set the ecommerce business apart from the competition and how it’s going to benefit the customer. Consumers are looking for differentiated experiences and brands that they can connect to. Show them how what you’re offering is different, and you’re one step ahead."
39,"A brand is about more than just the products a company sells. It's about every interaction a customer has with a company, and in 2022, delivering an outstanding customer experience is one of the main ways a business can differentiate itself.As customer acquisition has become harder and advertising costs continue to climb, businesses need to create an enjoyable and memorable experience around their brand—whether online, in person, or a combination of both—to ensure customers want to come back again and again. Customer expectations over the last couple of years have risen significantly, and customers now expect to be able to order online but return in store, or look at a product in a showroom and buy online, for example.To put it in perspective,73 percent of consumerssay that customer experience has a major impact on their purchasing decisions. That means almost three-quarters of shoppers would likely decide not to buy from a store (whether ecommerce or in person) that provides a poor experience.For this article, we dove into Shopify’sFuture of Commercereport and tapped a range of savvy Shopify Partners and insiders to explore how you can help merchants create a fantastic customer experience that stands out from the crowd.Check out Commerce Trends 2023The 2023 edition of Shopify’s annual report is now available. Learn about the latest trends shaping commerce, pulled from proprietary data, insider experts, and top global brands.See reportTransactional commerce is a thing of the pastEcommerce used to be a lot more transactional: Merchants created a product, put it on the internet, and somebody would find and buy it—most likely just once.Now ecommerce is all about long-term relationships. We have the ability to gather a lot of insights about our customers and their buying behavior, and tracking that information is a critical part of creating an experience tailored to our customers.“We’re in the early stages of moving from transactional to more contextual commerce,” Andrew Bialecki, founder ofKlaviyo, explains. “Transactional commerce tends to be pretty homogeneous. When you walk into a store, even if it's a huge big-box chain that has almost an infinite budget, they have no idea who you are and whether it’s your first or hundredth visit.”Companies tried to create the best experience for everybody possible, but now customers have become accustomed to personalized ecommerce experiences. Today, they are increasingly looking for differentiated experiences and brands they can connect to that share their values.Bialecki believes that building and owning direct customer relationships is really important. He advises to take advantage of the opportunity to ask consumers questions, collect information, and build more personalized, more contextualized experiences.“Land the customer on a custom landing page, so that they immediately see the products they're looking for,” suggests Sharon Goldstein, CEO ofLimeSpot. “Personalize product recommendations to rapidly put the right products in front of customers and put them in context to what else they've been browsing or buying.”Key techniques to create a great customer experienceCreating a memorable and seamless customer experience, whether online or in person, regardless of the channel, is essential to make shoppers happy. A smooth mobile performance is now a given, for example, as is a fast and painless checkout. Let’s take a look at some other ways you can achieve a fantastic customer experience.Start with the basicsInteractivity and cutting-edge technology like AR, VR, and 3D media can take your customer experience to the next level, but it’s important not to get carried away. “Too many times brands get distracted by the bells and whistles, and they forget the basics,” says Chelsea Jones, founder ofChelsea & Rachel Co.Before you explore new technology, ask yourself if the brand is servicing customers well, if they are getting their customers’ eyes on their products, and if customer service is already a priority.The smaller the brand, the easier it is to excel at customer service. Consider investing in a customer service platform, such asGorgias, for example, and check essentials like the mobile experienceHow you tell your story and what you stand for, while creating a consistent end-to-end customer experience, has become a critical differentiator. Wherever your audience happens to be, ensure the experience is consistent at every touchpoint in their journey. This might include replicating your website experience on social commerce channels to provide familiarity, for example.You might also like:10 Tips to Help Your Clients Handle Surging Customer Service Demand.Shopify Plus Technology Partner Gorgias is a one-stop shop for customer support, enabling you to have customer and order history at your fingertips.Build custom storefrontsIt’s now easier than ever to build a unique shopping experience withcustom storefronts, Shopify’s solution to going “headless.”Headless commerceseparates your front-end storefronts from your back-end systems, which gives you total creative control.Custom storefronts enable merchants to create virtual try-ons using AR, user-friendly product customization experiences to personalize the item they’re thinking of buying, or using gamification elements to make the checkout experience more fun, among other uses.“Headless will continue to be a major player,” believes LimeSpot CEO Sharon Golstein. “The benefits are being able to separate the product catalog from the frontend experience, allowing brands to differentiate themselves by having a site experience that's not theme-based but truly looks like how they want it to be, and having the opportunity to update content in an easier, smoother, and more continuous way.”African food company Yolélé used a custom storefront to create a one-of-a-kind visual product explorer.Balance personalization and privacyWhile personalization is now standard and customers want to feel known, they also have become more savvy and will only share their personal data if they trust a brand.In fact, Shopify’sFuture of Commercereport found that 46% of consumers say they're okay with brands theylikeusing their personal information to deliver relevant content and offers. What’s more, consumers areover three times more likelyto abandon brands that “over-personalize,” compared to brands that fail to personalize enough.So be subtle and don’t include too much personal data in customized communication, or you risk scaring the customer away.Create a communityTo strengthen relationships with customers, many brands are turning to community building. Whether it’s through social commerce, adding a live chatroom to their proprietary site, or creating in-real-life experiences, communities foster brand awareness, loyalty, and retention. At the same time, communities lower customer support costs.“Brands have a big opportunity to reach people in a much more authentic and interactive way now,” explains Yulie Kwon Kim, VP of Product Management at Facebook. “I'm really excited about live shopping, for example, because it marries the authenticity and the conversations that you would have in store, but brings them online in a rich way.”The key is to not only create a space for customers to connect with the brand but also for fellow supporters to connect with each other. “You often see consumers talking to each other during live shopping events. They might say things like, ‘I actually bought this product two days ago, and it’s great,’ which builds trust and is also fun.”Cruelty-free beauty brand Doe Lashes not only shares content on Discord but also uses feedback from its Discord community members to inform product innovations and new designs.Be as flexible as you canCustomer service is a major part of providing a positive customer experience, and one way to do that is by making the customer journey and buying process as safe, convenient, and flexible as possible.According to research conducted for Shopify’s Future of Commerce report, 50% of consumers are more likely to order a product online if shipping is free, 33% if it’s fast, and 25% if it’s flexible. Nadine Iacocca, chief strategy and growth officer atStream Commerce, has learned—both pre-pandemic and now—that solutions and services need to be simple and flexible above all else.“The consumer has a varying degree of needs,” she explains. “They are also demanding a much higher degree of services and customer experience online. So the solution needs to be simple as well as flexible, and how you deliver that is key.”Flexibility takes many forms, and Iacocca recommends offering customers different options throughout the purchase journey, robust search and filters, and tools that predict the consumer’s needs or wants. Another way to offer flexibility is by using brick-and-mortar locations as fulfillment centers for blended shipping options likebuy online, pick up in-store (BOPIS).Communicate with transparencyTransparency is not only important in terms of privacy and security, it’s also an essential part of how you communicate shipping information.Shopify’s Future of Commerce report found that 46% of shoppers are actively looking to shop from businesses that clearly show anticipated delivery times. And it’s not just the shipping per se that customers are interested in. They also want to know whether a brand is adopting sustainable business practices for the manufacturing and delivery/return of the product to reduce the impact on the planet.It’s not surprising that 49% of the brands surveyed for the Future of Commerce report are investing in not just their delivery practices, but also in transparency with their deliverypromises, like sharing when an order is prepared and shipped.“A lot of merchants are starting to be more upfront about how exactly their product is made, how it’s shipped, and what the whole life cycle of the product looks like,” points out Michelle Tampoya, seniorproduct marketinglead for shipping and money at Shopify. “Is the carbon being offset, for example, and is the merchant being clear to the consumer that they care about it as much as they do?”So, establish open lines of communication, whether it’s through Instagram stories, blog posts, or email newsletters, to take consumers behind the scenes of your operation. Share why you make a product a certain way and how (fast) it’s going to be delivered. Chatbots are great but they should only be used to support the customer service team. It’s essential to have real people to proactively respond to—and resolve—issues like unexpected shipping delays.Ethical apparel retailer Good for Sunday displays their shipping speeds at checkout, presenting the customer with shipping options, related costs, and how long shipping is anticipated to take.Invest in a unique in-person experienceIn-person shopping experiences now pose a huge opportunity, as customers missed out on them during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic so much.To stay competitive, 40% of brands surveyed for Shopify’sFuture of Commercereport said offering experiential retail would be a top priority for them in 2022, something 32% of consumers said they are likely to engage with.Physical retail is making a resurgence, and many direct-to-consumer brands are investing in pop-up shops. As some consumers are still hesitant to go back to physical stores, however, creating an interesting and unique experience that’s different to the ecommerce offering is crucial to attract shoppers back in person.“Nothing compares with walking into a physical store and being greeted by a great experience,” says Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy atPublicis Sapient. “Even by 2023 and 2024, we're predicting that up to 80% of all revenues are going to come through the physical stores. They aren't going away, it's more about reimagining them. Can you get away with a smaller footprint store, for example? Can you do a pop-up store? Can you embed digital into those stores? It's really about thinking about it from the entire ecosystem for a retailer.”Experiential retail experiences are especially suitable for more luxurious brands.“People are going to want to be catered to with a white glove service,” points out Chelsea Jones. “That's something that ecommerce will always lack. Now that we can get anything at our fingertips on our phone, the retail space is going to be more experiential-led.”Direct-to-consumer bras and underwear brand Lively started by hosting in-person events in their brand ambassadors’ home cities to gauge interest in brick-and-mortar stores.Build a customer-centric strategy for long-term successA lot of companies still put their own product or service first, not their customers. However, to really optimize engagement and boost sales, you need to create a truly customer-rather than product-centric experience.“Businesses that not only own their customers and know who they are, but are speaking and listening to them, will have a definite advantage going forward,” points out Robert Befumo, head of ecommerce strategy and marketing atParkfield Commerce.The above tips are just a few suggestions to get you started on your journey to place your customers at the heart of everything. Carry out research involving real customers to explore what works best for the brands you’re working with, ensure the experience is consistent and seamless across the various channels you choose to interact on, and finetune it with attention to detail to foster long-term relationships with happy shoppers. These are surefire ways to discover the right path to great customer experiences."
40,"As new online platforms gain popularity, we can see that ecommerce doesn't just apply to websites. New opportunities are opening up for merchants to connect with buyers, and you can now add commerce features to any platform withShopify Marketplace Kit. Marketplace Kit enables you to use Shopify's commerce features and connects your platform to millions of merchants and their products.What’s new with the latest Marketplace Kit?With the latest version, it's now incredibly fast to build a basic marketplace using Marketplace Kit. To speed up your development workflow, we've decoupled from the Shopify CLI and created two new apps to help get you started.Marketplace Kitallows you to start building a marketplace whether you have an existing platform or not. The world’s most innovative brands, such as Meta, TikTok, and Pinterest, have used Marketplace Kit to add commerce to their platforms.You can use our flexible APIs to add commerce to an existing platform, or use our apps to build a brand new marketplace. Additionally, you get access to millions of Shopify merchants who can install your sales channel and start selling their products on your existing or new platform.We knew there were an abundance of independent brands competing for customers' attention, and after some quick research, we found that 90%+ of them were using Shopify. It's a no brainer really. Shopify is a fantastic platform for getting an E-Commerce business up and running in no time at all.Jake Dormer, Co-Founder ofAvesteHow does it work?Shopify Marketplace Admin appInitially, Marketplace Kit provided walkthrough tutorials on how to create a merchant-facing app and connect it to an external marketplace, easing the complicated process of developing a marketplace channel app (merchant-facing in the Shopify admin) and connecting it externally. Now, we've gone a step further and removed the need to build a merchant-facing app from scratch.Instead, we've created theShopify Marketplace Admin app, an out-of-the-box starting point for your merchant-facing marketplace app. This app comes with authentication, routing, basic pages,Channels-UIintegration and key API calls built in. No need for weeks of setup time now, simply clone the repo and go!In creating the Shopify Marketplace Admin app we used widely used, readily available technologies that are well supported and documented. This means we can appeal to the largest number of partners possible.The key technology that’s used in the Shopify Marketplaces admin app are:YarnNPMNodeExpressWebpackReactSequelizeChannels UI LibraryGraphQL and RESTStorefront APIShopify Marketplaces Buyer appMany Shopify partners already own or manage an existing platform and wish to embed commerce into it. But there's a growing number of partners and agencies that don't have a buyer-facing marketplace yet.These marketplaces have previously been at a disadvantage because they have to build both the merchant-facing and buyer-facing experiences. To help, we created an app for partners who want to build a marketplace from the ground up and bundled it into our Shopify-specific opinions.TheShopify Marketplaces Buyer appis a springboard for partners who don't already have a marketplace. This app gives you a basic marketplace, complete with a frontend and backend. Developers can use this app as a starting point for their own marketplace vision and can see how it ties in directly with the merchant-facing app.We've packaged up key features and API calls into this app to help reduce the complexity and heavy lift of initial setup. We don’t see the app as an out-of-the-box, production-ready, solution for marketplaces. However, it's a valuable starting point that you can easily build on and customize because it incorporates key technology that's widely used.Key technology that's used in Shopify marketplaces buyer app includes:Main frontend framework: NextJS, which is a framework for ReactJSMain CSS library: MUI - Material UIData fetching: GraphQLThe Shopify API that provides store channel data: Storefront APIThese two starter apps, coupled withdetailed walkthrough tutorialsin our developer documentation, mean that getting started with creating a marketplace or embedding commerce on your existing platform has never been easier.Keeping our store in sync was made a whole lot easier by the product listing API and webhooks. Shopify's developer documentation is fantastic. They had a dedicated area on their dev site for sales channels and so we quickly began to build the app & site.Jake Dormer, Co-Founder of AvesteAveste showcases products from multiple Shopify fashion merchantsWhat’s in it for me?Fast setup timeFollowing the instructions, we were able to create a basic marketplace from scratch using the Shopify Marketplaces Buyer and Shopify Marketplaces Admin apps in just eight minutes. Can it be done faster? We’re sure it can!We've worked with partners of all sizes and have seen that it can take months to build the initial setup. Because of this we have condensed everything we've learned over the last few years into the Marketplace Kit experience. Any size partner can learn from what we’ve baked into our code. Pull the common patterns and use as the need arises.We’ve got the nitty-gritty coveredWe’ve removed the heavy-lifting of common code that all partners will need to include in their merchant-facing app. No matter the platform or partner size, there are some things that all admin apps need to do. These include:Connecting to a merchant’s storeRetrieving and storing dataDisplay an overview pageDisplay an onboarding pageThe process for these can be quite complex, connecting to multiple merchant stores and saving storefront access tokens for shop data retrieval in particular. We used theStorefront APIcoupled with JWT authentication using App Bridge, Shopify’s Node API and Express, for serving REST and GraphQL. You can read more about why we chose these technologies on our Engineering blog post.Start customizing right awayOur apps use common technology (see above) that is well supported so customizing is easy from the get go. For example, we use theMUI - Material UIlibrary as the main CSS library for the buyer-facing app. If you don’t want to use this library, you can easily swap it out for your own CSS library.Another example is theOnboarding pagein the merchant-facing app. We've provided a simple onboarding page with an information card and placeholder text to get you started. You can create new sections, add more components and more using the patterns that exist in the merchant-facing repo andChannels-UI.Tutorials and walkthroughs onshopify.dev/marketplacesOur tutorials are tried and tested. Coupled with the apps you can add additional functionality to your marketplace.So, how do I get started?It is as easy as one, two, three. Well, there are actually eight steps to follow to get up and running, but you get it— it’s fast. We've completed the setup in eight minutes and would love to see how quickly it can be done.The prerequisites:You have the Shopify CLI installedYou have the Sequelize CLI installedYou've installed the latest versions of Node.js and npmYou have Yarn installedYou've created a Partner account and a development storeYou have created an app in the Partners dashboard and have turned it into a sales channelThe instructions:CloneShopify Marketplaces Admin appInstall and run yarnRun migrations (```npx sequelize-cli db:migrate```)Create a .env file in the root and add the following scopes: unauthenticated_read_product_listings,read_product_listingsRun Shopify CLI (```shopify app serve```) and follow promptsCloneShopify Marketplaces Buyer appInstall and run yarnRun buyer appLet’s go!You now have a solid starting point for your marketplace and can begin exploring the code, the tutorials, and how to customize.

42,"Say the phrase ""digital marketing"" and you're likely to get a range of reactions. It's easy to love, since it's a critical tool for finding new customers. However, digital marketing is also becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to do, especially for independent brands.That's why we are excited to announce the launch of Shopify Audiences, a powerful prospecting tool that works to enhance top of funnel advertising campaigns by targeting high-intent buyers. Shopify Agency Partners can now use Shopify Audiences to help Plus merchants with one of their biggest pain points: finding new customers who are ready to buy.With the growing difficulty of finding new customers, Shopify Audiences has been key to getting our campaign performance back to where we need it to be. We have loved connecting with high-intent audiences and have really seen our targeting and performance improve, with return on ad spend as high as 6x. It’s now a key part of our advertising strategy.Chase Waters, Director of Digital Marketing atBlenderBottleWhat is Shopify Audiences?Shopify Audiences is a new way to find and target high-intent buyers on advertising platforms. Shopify Audiences uses the collective power of Shopify merchants that band together to unlock the power of their data. Buyers who purchase from our merchants are some of the highest quality customers on the internet.When you're running ads for your client, simply select the product you want Shopify to help you sell more of, and we'll take care of the heavy lifting underneath using machine learning algorithms to find people most likely to purchase.Simply tell Shopify which product you want to sell more of and we'll do the rest.The algorithm matches buyer intent with unique attributes of store products and orders data to predict who is most likely to purchase from a shop. Audiences are created using lists of authorized email addresses from recent buyers. Currently, we support Meta (Facebook and Instagram Ads), and we have plans to support all major ad platforms in the coming year. To protect buyer privacy, merchants cannot download a list of the hashed emails exported from Shopify to target a competitor's list of customers.A unique view into order attribution that only Shopify can provideWhen you’re running ads using Shopify Audiences, we make it easy to understand the value they bring to your clients’ businesses. To do this, we use a unique attribution model exclusively available in Shopify to help you understand how orders are attributed to Audiences.Shopify sees the emails inside audiences as well as emails at checkout, so you can get a unique perspective to better understand the effectiveness of ads you’re running for your clients. This model is resilient to changes in user-tracking regulations due to privacy laws. We have high confidence in its accuracy and believe this will help your agency demonstrate value add.When an order is processed, Shopify checks if the email on the order matches any customer in your audience. If so, the order will be attributed to Shopify Audiences. Orders are counted while you’re actively running ads using an audience. Shopify also counts orders received within seven days after ads have stopped running to account for people who saw your ads and decided to buy later.When we developed Shopify Audiences, transparency and trust were the top priority. As such, the tool will only “take credit” for an order when Shopify Audiences has very high confidence that it was responsible for the order. We'd rather take less credit than more.We use statistical modeling to exclude orders from people who may not have seen your ads but were in your audience. These are called unrelated orders, and occur when a customer purchases a product due to other paid or organic marketing unrelated to Shopify Audiences.Shopify models unrelated orders by observing how many orders an audience receives while no ads using that audience were running. Once unrelated orders are modeled, they’re excluded from that store’s audience order totals. What remains is a conservative estimate of how many orders should be attributed to Shopify Audiences.A single order can be attributed to multiple audiences. This happens when a customer belongs to more than one audience. Shopify resolves audience overlap by equally splitting orders between audiences in an effort to ensure your reports are free of duplicate data. You can check how much overlap gets removed between audiences under the “Resolved overlap” section in audience reports.Shopify Audiences prioritizes transparency.Audience reporting data will vary compared to ad platforms. This happens due to differences in attribution models used, as well as ad platforms not having access to order data the way that Shopify does. To understand your advertising effectiveness, you should use reports in Shopify Audiences for sales and order data and rely on third-party reports for spend, impressions, and clicks.Improvements to the algorithm will continue to roll out over time. We recommend making Shopify Audiences a part of your continuous, top-of-funnel customer prospecting strategy.Shopify Audiences has helped us regain confidence with top-of-funnel advertising and reach qualified buyers with return on ad spend as high as 3x. The ability to leverage Shopify’s understanding of intent and create audiences focused on our products significantly enhances our acquisition efforts.TJ Ferrara, Co-Founder of BUBS NaturalFor now, Shopify Audiences is available to Shopify Plus store owners who use Shopify Payments.

43,"Automation technology for ecommerce retailers has been a growing discussion for years. With the rapid digitization we've experienced and how quickly brands have jumped over to digital, automation is quickly becoming more than just a nice-to-have. It's become a necessity for businesses that want to scale.With Shopify Flownow availableto merchants on the Advanced Plan, the possibilities for your clients have just opened up tenfold.Read on to learn how Flow can be used to put time-consuming tasks on autopilot, simplify day-to-day operations, and scale into the future. And most importantly, learn what it all means for your clients' growth trajectory.What is Shopify Flow and how does it work?Shopify Flow is a no-code (unless you want to)ecommerce automationtool that helps merchants cut down on manual tasks. With Flow's simple drag-and-drop interface, anyone can quickly build workflow automations that eliminate the need to spend hours on manual repetitive tasks.The logic that powers Flow's workflow automations is built on three core components: triggers, conditions, and actions.Let's break that down:Trigger:An event that begins a workflow. This can be an event that happens in a Shopify store or within an app.Condition:A rule that determines whether an action will be taken.Action:A task that's executed when conditions are met.Not sure where to start? Test out one of the thousands of pre-madeworkflow templatesavailable. All workflows—whether they are pulled from a template or built from scratch—are completely customizable.What are the benefits of Shopify Flow?Shopify Flow helps merchants get more done, in less time. And as great as that is in itself, the benefits go beyond that.Saves time and creates a better work environmentOne of the most obvious benefits to Shopify Flow is that it helps businesses save time by automating manual, repetitive processes. If you can help a merchant win back hours—or even days—of productive working time, you'll undoubtedly be their knight in shining armor.And as a byproduct of this, there are even more benefits that your clients will reap. When a team is freed up from having to perform low-value, manual tasks, employees have more time and energy to focus on high-value strategic work—like creative problem-solving that can have a much bigger business impact.Additionally, when employees can forgo tedious tasks and focus on what they do best—whether it's marketing, customer service, or sales—they are happier at work. This morale boost can help retain strong talent, which is a huge value-add during a time when The Great Resignation is still a hot topic of concern for business owners.Eliminates human errorFor every online purchase a customer makes, there are multiple behind-the-scenes tasks and touchpoints that need to be fulfilled before it finally reaches the customer's doorstep. It's also inevitable that each task completed manually comes with risk of human error—no matter how careful we try to be.Let's look at an inventory and merchandising example that proves this point. Say a seller has hundreds of products in their catalog and are experiencing increased order velocity. They're manually keeping track of inventory levels—watching when product stock falls below a certain threshold, temporarily hiding products when they're out of stock, and re-opening product pages when stock is replenished.That's a lot to manage manually. It would be very easy (and understandable) for a person to accidentally leave a product page hidden for longer than needed, or to have an item unexpectedly run out of stock before re-ordering a new shipment.Instead of leaving those small-yet-important tasks up to chance, you can show your clients how to avoid mishaps like these with Flow. Tasks—like temporarily hiding pages as soon as a product goes out of stock—can be executed in real-time without anyone having to lift a finger. Most importantly, merchants have the assurance that routine tasks won't slip between the cracks.Creates a repeatable, scalable processManual tasks and processes can be manageable with a small team and lower order volume. But as things pick up, those once-simple tasks quickly add up.For example, let's say a seller wants to apply a tag to customers who have placed more than one order because they plan to send out a discount code for repeat customers. This isn't a difficult task if you're receiving a hundred or so orders a week. However, when order volume creeps into the hundreds or thousands, this is no longer an easy feat.To scale a business, repetitive and manual tasks should be automated to improve efficiency and minimize potential errors that could come with expansion.Examples of Shopify Flow in the wildImprovedinventory management.Avoid stockouts by creating notifications for when inventory goes below a certain threshold. Merchants can also set up notifications for when customer demand increases for out-of-stock products, so they can prioritize upcoming shipments.Smarter marketing spend.When a product is out-of-stock, send a Slack message or email to your marketing team so they can temporarily pause advertising for that product until it's back in stock.Better buyer experience.Easily create customer tags based on behaviors, such as number of orders placed or preferred sales channels. With more intel directly attributed to your customers, you can easily create segmented lists to personalize communications based on the customer. For example, you may want to send long-time customers a thank-you card for their loyalty. Or, you may want to provide an educator's discount based on .edu email addresses used to place orders.Stellar shipping communication.Merchants can notify customers about every step of their order, without ever lifting a finger. With Shopify Flow, automations can be created to send customers push notifications once an order is shipped or emails when their package is out for delivery. Setting up simple automations like these can be huge for customer loyalty and retention.Fraud prevention.Set up workflows that assess risk and make smart decisions based on the conditions you've set. For example, if an order's shipping country and billing country don't match, you may want to review the order before it gets processed. You can set a number of conditions that could flag an order as high-risk and different actions depending on the level of risk—like automatically canceling an order if it’s placed from a blacklisted email address.Helping your clients scale their businesses with Shopify FlowThere's a lot that Shopify Flow can do. With thousands of pre-made templates and dozens of app integrations, the options are seemingly endless. Now, the question is, how do you know where to start with your clients?Nail down pain pointsWith so many options available, Shopify Flow can be difficult for people who are new to the tool to conceptualize how it fits in with their business. To nail down which tasks and processes would benefit from automation, spend some finding your clients pain points.Try to get to the bottom of where their workflow is bottling. Sellers may also want to consider any recent customer complaints or team feedback they've received lately. Is there anything that the company could be doing better that automation can help solve?Once you've helped a client explore their pain points, it becomes easier to identify which processes benefit from automation.Don't feel nervous about diving inThe great thing about Shopify Flow is that automations can be set up in minutes and can be easily revised as needs change—so there's no need to overthink it and fall into the paralysis by analysis trap.
